<p class="noindent">What is meant by a Language? It is a collection
of all the words, phrases, grammatical forms,
idioms, &amp;c., which are used by one people. It is
the outward expression of the tendencies, turn of
mind, and habits of thought of some one nation,
and the best criterion of their intellect and feelings.
If this explanation be admitted, it will
naturally follow that the connection between a
people and their language is so close, that the
one may be judged of by the other; and that the
language is a lasting monument of the nature and
character of the people.</p>

<p>Every language, then, has its genius; forms of
words, idioms, and turns of expression peculiar
to itself; by which, independently of other differences,
one nation may be distinguished from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
another. This condition may be produced by various
causes; such as soil, climate, conquest, immigration,
&amp;c. Out of the old Roman, or Latin,
there arose several modern languages of Europe;
all known by the generic name&mdash;Romance; viz.
Italian, French, Provençal, Spanish, and Portuguese.
These may be called daughters of ancient
Latin; and the natives of all these countries
down to the seventh century, both spoke and
wrote that language. But when the Scandinavian
and Germanic tribes invaded the West of
Europe, the Latin was broken up, and was succeeded
by Italian, French, Spanish, &amp;c. The
Latin now became gradually more and more corrupt,
and was, at length, in each of these countries,
wholly remodelled.</p>

<p>History has been called ‘the study of the law
of change;’ i.e. the process by which human
affairs are transferred from one condition to another.
The history of a language has naturally
a close analogy with political history; the chief
difference being that the materials of the latter
are facts, events, and institutions; whilst the
former treats of words, forms, and constructions.
Now, in the same way as a nation never stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
still, but is continually undergoing a silent&mdash;perhaps
imperceptible&mdash;transformation, so it is with
its language. This is proved both by experience
and reason. We need hardly say that the English
of the present time differ widely from the
English of the fourteenth century; and we may
be quite sure that the language of this country,
two or three centuries hence, will be very different
from what it is at present. It would be
impossible for a nation either to improve or decay,
and for its language at the same time to remain
stationary. The one being a reflex of the other,
they must stand or fall together.</p>

<p>What, then, is this law of change? On what
principles is it based? How are we to study or
follow out its operations? These questions are
exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to answer
definitively. But there are circumstances connected
with the formation of certain languages
which may throw some light on them. It may be
received as a principle that, when one nation is
overrun or conquered by another, the effect on
the language of the conquered depends mainly on
the condition of that which is brought in by the
conquerors. If the victors be as superior to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
vanquished in civilisation and improvement as
they have proved themselves in physical power,
they will impose their language on the conquered
people. If, on the other hand, that of the vanquished
be the more cultivated, the reverse will
take place; the dialect of the conquerors will be
absorbed into that of the conquered.</p>

<p>When the Visigoths settled in Spain in the
fifth century, their dialect made but little impression
on the language afterwards known as
Spanish. The Latin element in the Peninsula,
though at that time falling into decay, was far
more refined and polished than the barbarous
dialect then introduced; and it consequently remained,
with some slight modifications, the language
of the country. The same happened when
the Northmen settled in France in the tenth
century. It is astonishing how rapidly the language
of Rollo and his followers was absorbed
into French! This may have been assisted by
the intermarriage of the conquerors with the
women of the country; but it was produced
chiefly by the different conditions of the two
languages.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when the Normans, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
William the Conqueror, invaded England in the
eleventh century, a different effect was produced.
The Norman French after a time, though not
immediately, enriched the English language with
many words, but it did not, in the slightest degree,
either then or afterwards, affect its grammatical
forms or idioms. The cause of this was
that the Saxon language was, at that epoch,
already fixed, and fit for literary purposes. It
was, indeed, much further advanced as a literary
language than the invading Norman-French. It
therefore resisted this external pressure; and
though it afterwards admitted numerous French
terms, the English language remains to this day
Saxon, and not French, in its tone, character, and
grammar.</p>

<p>The climate of a country, or the temperament
of a people, may also strongly influence the
character of the language. Given an indolent
and luxurious race, and we must expect that
softness and effeminacy will appear in their
spoken and written expression. No acute observer
can fail to perceive a close connection
between the national character of the Italians
and the softness and beauty of their harmonious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
tongue. Again: the simplicity and somewhat
homely and rough vigour of the Teutonic race,
are clearly shadowed forth in the sounds and
forms of the German language.</p>

<p>The climate, too, in both cases, may have contributed
towards these results. A hot, enervating
atmosphere produces languor of mind as well as
body; whilst a bracing cold air, though it may
assist in producing a phlegmatic temperament, at
the same time infuses vigour, energy, and power
into those who are subjected to its influence.</p>

<p>There are also, no doubt, many hidden causes
of gradual changes in language. These are difficult
to ascertain; and some of them escape the
sagacity of even the most acute observers. Political
struggles, foreign wars, domestic habits,
literary studies, &amp;c., may all contribute to alter
the character of a people, and so far to affect
their language.</p>

<p>But whatever may be these mysterious laws of
change, they must be left to Nature herself, and
no one must attempt to interfere with them.
There are no more miserable failures recorded
in history than the attempt by rulers to interfere
with the laws of Nature. We are told (though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
not on very good authority) that William the
Conqueror <em>ordered the Saxons to speak Norman-French</em>.
He might as well have ordered his new
subjects to walk on their heads&mdash;the one was
quite as easy as the other. But no writer tells us
with what success this decree was executed. Ordericus
Vitalis, indeed, states that William endeavoured
to learn Saxon, though he does not say
how far he succeeded. Now it is not very likely
that he should have studied a language which he
was, at the same time, bent on exterminating.
Indeed, there is an air of extreme improbability
about the whole story.</p>

<p>In more recent times, it is well known that
Joseph II., of Germany, issued an edict that all
his subjects, Slavonic, Magyar, or German, should
adopt one uniform language&mdash;German. But it
was soon found impossible to execute this decree,
for the people would as soon have parted with
their lives as with their language; the whole
empire was, therefore, immediately thrown into
confusion. Many of the provinces broke out into
open rebellion, and it at length became necessary
to abandon the project.</p>

<p>It is then clear that no one has the power, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
his own will or caprice, to add a single word to a
language, or to cast one out of it. These changes
must be left to Nature, and all we can do is to
watch her operations, to observe and record facts.
But we may speculate on the origin of words, and
may sometimes discover the causes of their birth.
We may also inquire into the circumstances of
their career, and the laws which regulate their
forms, changes, meanings, &amp;c. These inquiries
are particularly comprehensive and interesting,
because they naturally lead us to some knowledge
of what words represent, and also because they
are closely connected with the study of the human
mind both as regards intellect and passion.</p>

<span class="fs40">ORIGIN OF WORDS&mdash;FAMILIES OF WORDS.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Most Philologists have hitherto held the opinion
that, in general, no satisfactory account can be
given of the origin of language. They can trace a
word from one language to another, and can account
for its various forms and changes by laws
now generally understood; but they confess their
inability to explain what determined the original
form of its root. They take that original form
for granted, as a sort of intuitive truth which
must be admitted as a necessity. They can explain
the circumstances of its career; but of its
first cause or nature they profess to understand
little or nothing.</p>

<p>But though this is the general opinion, all linguists
admit that in every language certain words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
more especially those that convey ideas of sound,
are formed on the principle of <em>onomatopœia</em>; i.e.
an attempt to make the pronunciation conform to
the sound. Such English words as ‘hiss,’ ‘roar,’
‘bang,’ ‘buzz,’ ‘crash,’ &amp;c., are of this class.
One can hardly pronounce these words without,
in some sense, performing the acts which they
represent.</p>

<p>One school of linguists have lately expressed a
belief that all words were formed on this principle.
A very curious illustration of this view is
given in Mr. Wedgwood’s ‘Origin of Language.’
Explaining the interjection <em>Hem</em>, he says, it was
originally an attempt to stop some one. We
are supposed to be walking behind some person;
we wish to stop him, and we exclaim, ‘<em>Hem!</em>’
This is given as the primary meaning of the word.
‘The sound is here an echo to the sense.’ But
<em>hem</em> is used in other ways; either as a noun, or a
verb; always, however, retaining its original idea
of restricting, or keeping back. The <em>hem</em> of a
garment is what <em>prevents</em> the thread from ravelling.
Again, soldiers are sometimes <em>hemmed</em> in
by the enemy; that is, <em>prevented</em> from using their
free will to go where they choose. This illustration
is intended to prove that the principle of
onomatopœia applies not only to words that represent
sound, but, by analogy, to other meanings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
derived from that principle. There <em>is</em> sound implied
in the interjection <em>hem</em>; though in the noun
and the verb, both derived from that interjection,
no idea of sound is conveyed.</p>

<p>This connection between sound and sense is
certainly a natural principle; and however scornfully
it may have been ridiculed by some philosophers,
it has undoubtedly produced many very fine
passages in the poetry of both ancient and modern
times.</p>

<p>1. The chorus of frogs in Aristophanes, where
their croaking is represented by words invented
for the occasion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Βρεκεκεξ, κοαξ, κοαξ.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">This is, to say the least of it, very ingenious, and,
in its way, beautiful, because true.</p>

<p>2. The same principle seems to apply in the
πολυφλοίσβοιο θαλάσσης (poluphloisboio thalassēs)
of Homer, where the first word was probably
intended to represent the roaring of the wave
mounting on the sea-shore; and the second, the
hissing sound which accompanies a receding
billow.</p>

<p>3. Another example of onomatopœia, in Virgil’s
Æneid, viii. 452, has been often quoted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<p class="verse">‘Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum;’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">where the succession of dactyls is admirably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
adapted to represent the sound of the hoofs of a
galloping horse.</p>

<p>4. Several examples of the same figure may be
found in Milton. Describing the thronging of the
fallen angels in Pandemonium:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Thick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air,</p>
<p class="verse">Bru<em>sh</em>ed with the hi<em>ss</em> of ru<em>st</em>ling win<em>gs</em>.</p>
</div></div>

<p>5. Also, speaking of the gates of hell:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse12">... open fly</p>
<p class="verse">Th’ infe<em>r</em>nal doo<em>r</em>s; and on their hinges g<em>r</em>ates</p>
<p class="verse">Ha<em>r</em>sh thunde<em>r</em> ...</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Here the recurrence of the letter <em>r</em> is well calculated
to convey the idea of a harsh, creaking,
grating sound.</p>

<p>6. A similar effect is produced in Tasso’s ‘Gerusalemme
Liberata.’</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="it" xml:lang="it">
<p class="verse">Il <em>r</em>auco son della Ta<em>r</em>tarea tromba.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">This connection between sound and sense may
very probably exist in many words where we now
fail to perceive it; but in the present state of our
knowledge of the subject, we can hardly pronounce
positively in favour of this view as applied
to the whole body of a language. The question
remains, for the present, in abeyance.</p>


<h3><em>Families of Words (Saxon).</em></h3>

<p>But setting aside the origin of words, it is not
difficult to show the affinity which many springing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
from the same root have for each other. There
are in English, as in other languages, hundreds of
words which may be said to have a family connection,
and which are traceable to one common
origin, or root. This connection may be
found in the Saxon as well as the Romance part of
our language. <em>Th</em> (soft) may be considered as
the type of the idea of demonstration. All the
English pronouns and adverbs beginning with
these letters have that general meaning, which
may be seen in ‘<em>th</em>at,’ ‘<em>th</em>e,’ ‘<em>th</em>ere,’ ‘<em>th</em>ence,’
‘<em>th</em>is,’ ‘<em>th</em>ither,’ ‘<em>th</em>ose,’ ‘<em>th</em>us,’ and others. Again,
the initial <em>wh</em> may be considered as the type of an
interrogative, or relative meaning. This also may
be seen in many English pronouns and adverbs;
as in ‘<em>wh</em>at,’ ‘<em>wh</em>en,’ ‘<em>wh</em>ence,’ ‘<em>wh</em>ere,’ ‘<em>wh</em>ither,’
‘<em>wh</em>o,’ ‘<em>wh</em>om,’ ‘<em>wh</em>ose,’ &amp;c. The principle of
inversion has affected the whole of this class of
words. They are all of Saxon origin, and were
spelled in that language <em>hw</em>, and not <em>wh</em>; as in
‘hwæt’ (what), ‘hwaer’ (where), ‘hwanne’
(when), &amp;c.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Tw.</em></p>

<p>The Saxon initial <em>tw</em> corresponds with the Romance
<em>du</em>. There are many English words having
this initial, which convey the idea of ‘two.’ 1.
The numeral itself, ‘<em>tw</em>o’ 2. ‘<em>Tw</em>ain,’ a now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
obsolete form of ‘two.’ 3. ‘<em>Tw</em>in,’ one of <em>tw</em>o
children born at a birth. 4. ‘Be<em>tw</em>een,’ which
is only another form of ‘by twain.’ 5. ‘<em>Tw</em>ilight,’
i.e. between <em>tw</em>o lights&mdash;daylight and lamplight.
6. ‘<em>Tw</em>ice’ is equivalent to ‘<em>tw</em>o’ times. 7. To
‘<em>tw</em>ist’ is to bend <em>tw</em>o or more threads together.
8. To ‘<em>tw</em>ine’ is to interlace, so as to form one
body out of <em>tw</em>o. And 9. A ‘<em>tw</em>ig’ is so called
from its being easily twisted.</p>

<p>It is said that the word ‘nose’ originally signified
a promontory&mdash;something prominent&mdash;and
that it is so called from being the prominent
feature of the face. This view is supported by
its analogy with <em>naze</em>, a headland, and the Scotch
<em>ness</em> (as in Inver<em>ness</em>), a part of the coast which
juts forward. It may be observed that the word
meaning ‘nose’ has in most European languages
the form <span class="fs80">N-S-</span>. This may be seen in the Greek
νῆσος, an island or promontory; the Latin <em>nasus</em>,
the Italian <em>naso</em>, the German <em>Nase</em>, the French <em>nez</em>,
and the English <em>nose</em>. Whether this be or be not
an onomatopœia one thing is certain, viz. that
in English the initial sn (ns inverted) in so many
cases expresses nasal action, that it may be taken
as a general type of that meaning. This may be
found in a multitude of words having that initial,
all expressing various actions of the nose. It may
be seen in ‘<em>sn</em>arl,’ ‘<em>sn</em>eer,’ ‘<em>sn</em>eeze,’ ‘<em>sn</em>iff,’ ‘<em>sn</em>ore,’
‘<em>sn</em>ort,’ ‘<em>sn</em>ooze,’ ‘<em>sn</em>out,’ ‘<em>sn</em>ub,’ ‘<em>sn</em>uff,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Ber-an&mdash;to bear.</em></p>

<p>This is the source of our English verb ‘to bear.’
It produces the following:&mdash;1. ‘Barrow,’ an implement
used for carrying or <em>bearing</em>. 2. ‘Berth,’
a place in which one is <em>borne</em>. 3. ‘Bier,’ a coffin
in which a corpse is <em>borne</em> to the grave. 4.
‘Birth,’ the <em>bearing</em> of a child. 5. ‘Berry,’ the
fruit which a tree <em>bears</em>.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Bles-an&mdash;to blow.</em></p>

<p>From this verb we have, 1. ‘Blaze,’ a strong
flame <em>blown</em> forth. 2. ‘Blast,’ a violent <em>blowing</em>,
or gust of wind. 3. ‘Blain,’ a boil, or <em>blowing</em> up
of the flesh. 4. ‘Blight,’ injury done to corn,
&amp;c., from being <em>blasted</em>. 5. ‘Blister,’ a <em>blowing</em>,
or rising, up of the skin. 6. ‘Blossom’ (or
‘bloom’), the <em>blowing</em> forth of the flower. 7.
‘Blush,’ a <em>blowing</em> forth of the blood. 8. ‘Bluster,’
as the wind when <em>blowing</em> hard.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Brecc-an&mdash;to break.</em></p>

<p>1. The English verb ‘to break’ is directly from
the above. 2. ‘Bridge,’ a building which <em>breaks</em>
a passage across a river, &amp;c. 3. ‘Breach,’ that
part of a wall or fortification <em>broken</em> into by artillery.
4. To ‘broach’ a cask of ale is to <em>break</em>
into it. 5. A ‘brook’ is a stream of water which
<em>breaks</em> its way across the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Bug-an&mdash;to bend.</em></p>

<p>1. A ‘bay’ is a <em>bending</em> in of the line of coast.
2. In sailors’ language, a ‘bight’ is the hollow
part of a bay, or a coil of rope <em>bent</em> round. 3.
A ‘bow’ is so called from its being <em>bent</em>. 4. To
make a ‘bow’ is to <em>bend</em> the body. 5. ‘Beam’
(compare the German ‘Baum’) is so named from
its property of <em>bending</em>. 6. A ‘bough’ is the
part of the tree that easily <em>bends</em>. 7. A ‘bower’
is made of branches bowed or <em>bent</em> down. 8. The
adjective ‘buxom’ (compare the German ‘biegsam’)
is properly <em>bending</em> or pliable. 9. ‘El<em>bow</em>’ is the
bow of the ell, or that part where the arm <em>bends</em>.
‘Big’ and ‘bag’ are probably from the same
source; they both convey the idea of something
<em>bent</em> round.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Ceap-ān&mdash;to exchange.</em></p>

<p>The essence of buying and selling lies in the
exchange of goods for money, or money for goods.
Hence come 1. the English word ‘chapman’
(sometimes contracted into <em>chap</em>), which properly
means a buyer and seller. 2. To ‘chaffer’ is to
bargain about a purchase. 3. ‘Cheap,’ bearing
a low price, refers to a similar transaction. 4.
We have also ‘<em>Cheap</em>side’ and ‘East<em>cheap</em>,’ originally
markets, or places for buying and selling.
5. Chepstow, Chipping Norton, and other names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of market-towns in England, are from the same
root. 6. The wind is said to <em>chop</em> when it changes
from one point of the compass to another.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Ceaw-an&mdash;to chew.</em></p>

<p>1. The older form of ‘chew’ was ‘chaw,’ which
we still occasionally hear in ‘chaw-bacon.’ 2.
The cud is the grass <em>chewed</em> by ruminating animals.
3. A quid of tobacco is a piece kept in
the mouth to be <em>chewed</em>.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Dael-an&mdash;to divide.</em></p>

<p>1. To ‘deal’ is from the above verb. It is
used in English in a variety of senses, all containing
the idea of dividing into parts. 2. A
certain sort of wood is called ‘deal’ from being
easily <em>divided</em>, or cut into planks. 3. To ‘deal’
cards is to <em>divide</em> them into packets or parcels.
4. Tradesmen ‘deal’ in certain articles when they
sell them in small, <em>divided</em> quantities. 5. We
also say ‘a great deal,’ speaking of a large part
<em>divided</em> from the mass. [‘<em>Some-deal</em>’ was formerly
said, but it is now obsolete.] 6. A ‘dole’
is a small part or share <em>dealt</em> out. (Compare
the German ‘theilen.’)</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Dic-ian&mdash;to dig.</em></p>

<p>From this Saxon verb we have, 1. To ‘dig.’ 2.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
‘Dike,’ a mound of earth ‘<em>dug</em>’ out. 3. ‘Ditch,’
a line ‘<em>dug</em>.’ 4. ‘Dagger,’ an instrument used
for ‘<em>digging</em>;’ and 5. ‘Dock,’ a place ‘<em>dug</em>’ out
on the side of a harbour or bank of a river,
where ships are repaired.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Drag-an&mdash;to draw.</em></p>

<p>This Saxon verb gives the English ‘to draw.’
From this we have, 1. ‘Dray,’ a heavy cart
<em>drawn</em> along. 2. A ‘drain,’ a tube to <em>draw</em> off
water. 3. A ‘draft,’ an order to <em>draw</em> out money
from a bank. 4. A ‘draught’ is a quantity of
liquid <em>drawn</em> into the mouth. 5. To ‘drawl’ is
to drag on the voice heavily. 6. ‘Drudge,’ and
7. ‘Dredge’ (for oysters, &amp;c.); both which express
a dragging or <em>drawing</em>. (Compare the
German ‘tragen’ and the Latin ‘trahere.’)</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Dropi-an&mdash;to drop.</em></p>

<p>From this root comes 1. The verb ‘to drop.’
2. To ‘droop,’ i.e. to lean downwards. 3. To
‘drip,’ or fall continually. 4. To ‘dribble,’ or
to fall in small ‘<em>drops</em>.’ 5. A ‘driblet,’ or a very
small <em>drop</em>.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Eri-an&mdash;to till.</em></p>

<p>1. To ‘ear,’ in the sense of ‘to plough,’ is now
obsolete in English, though we have an ‘ear,’ or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
spike, of corn&mdash;the result of <em>tilling</em>; and 3.
‘Earth,’ that which is <em>tilled</em> or cultivated.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Far-an&mdash;to journey.</em></p>

<p>1. From this verb (German ‘fahren’) comes
our verb to ‘fare;’ literally, to go on, or make a
journey. 2. The adverbs ‘fore,’ ‘forth,’ and ‘far’
convey a similar idea; viz. that of onward movement.
3. The ‘ford’ of a river is that point
at which it can be ‘fared,’ or crossed; and 4.
To ‘ferry’ is the act of faring, or passing across
a river or lake. 5. ‘Frith’ and ‘firth’ are formed
on the same principle; they are those parts of the
sea where one can be ferried across. 6. The first
syllable (<em>fur</em>) in the word ‘furlough’ belongs
to this family. It is leave (lough) granted to
a soldier to ‘fare,’ or journey, home for a time.
All these forms are devices to explain a variety
of modes of <em>faring</em>, or moving onwards.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Fed-an&mdash;to feed.</em></p>

<p>This gives us, 1. To ‘feed.’ 2. ‘Fat,’ the result
of being well ‘<em>fed</em>.’ 3. ‘Fodder,’ provision for
cattle; and, 4. ‘Food,’ that which ‘<em>feeds</em>,’ or supplies
nourishment.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Fi-an&mdash;to hate.</em></p>

<p>From this verb we have in English&mdash;1. A ‘fiend,’
one who <em>hates</em>. 2. Hence also comes ‘foe,’ an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
enemy, or one <em>hated</em>. 3. To the same root may
be traced ‘fie!’ an interjection expressing dislike
or <em>hatred</em>; 4. and also ‘foh!’ or ‘faugh!’ an exclamation
of disgust.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Fleaw-an&mdash;to flow.</em></p>

<p>Hence come, 1. ‘To flow.’ 2. ‘Fleet;’ a number
of ships that ‘<em>flow</em>,’ or swim, on the water.
3. The adjective ‘fleet,’ qualifying what <em>flows</em> by.
4. To ‘float,’ or swim, on the water; and, 5.
‘Flood,’ a large <em>flow</em> of water.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Fuli-an&mdash;to make dirty.</em></p>

<p>From this root come, 1. ‘Foul’ (putrid, offensive).
2. To ‘defile;’ to make ‘foul.’ 3. The
noun ‘filth,’ dirt. 4. The adjective ‘filthy;’ and
5. ‘Fulsome;’ full of filth, nauseous, disgusting.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>G-an&mdash;to go.</em></p>

<p>1. ‘Gan’ is the Saxon verb whence the
English ‘to go’ is derived. 2. This gives us ‘gait,’
i.e. a manner of ‘<em>going</em>;’ and, 3. ‘Gate,’ a door
through which one ‘<em>goes</em>.’ To these may be added
4. ‘Gang,’ a number of people ‘<em>going</em>’ together;
and, 5. the nautical term ‘gang-way,’ i.e. a
passage ‘to go’ through. 6. The verb ‘to gad,’
i.e. to be continually ‘<em>going</em>’ from one place to
another, also probably belongs to this family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Glowi-an&mdash;to burn.</em></p>

<p>The verb ‘to low,’ in the sense of ‘to burn,’
does not now exist in the language; but the above
verb gives us, 1. To ‘glow,’ i.e. to burn intensely;
whence come the forms, 2. ‘Gleam;’ 3. ‘Glimmer;’
and, 4. ‘Glimpse;’ 5. ‘Gloom,’ or a state
into which light ‘gleams;’ and, 6. the word
‘light,’ which is a participial form of the old verb to
‘low.’ In one English word the root ‘low’ is still
retained, viz. ‘whit<em>low</em>,’ a painful <em>white burning</em> on
the finger or thumb.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Graf-an&mdash;to dig.</em></p>

<p>From this verb we have in English, 1. ‘Grave,’
a pit <em>dug</em>. 2. To ‘engrave,’ i.e. to scratch or <em>dig</em>
in. 3. ‘Groove,’ a line <em>dug</em> in. 4. ‘Gravel,’ earth
<em>dug</em> up. 5. To ‘grovel,’ literally, to <em>dig</em> up earth;
and, 6. To ‘grub,’ or scratch into the earth.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Gyrd-an&mdash;to enclose.</em></p>

<p>The English words derived from ‘<em>gyrdan</em>,’ and
having a cognate meaning are, 1. To ‘gird,’ to
<em>enclose</em> by tying round. 2. ‘Girdle,’ a small band
or cincture. 3. ‘Girth,’ the band which ‘girds’
the saddle on a horse. 4. ‘Garter,’ a band tied
round the leg; and, 5. ‘Garden,’ a space <em>enclosed</em>
for the cultivation of fruit, vegetables, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Lang&mdash;long.</em></p>

<p>From the Anglo-Saxon and German ‘lang’ is derived,
1. our adjective ‘long;’ from which again
comes, 2. the abstract noun ‘length.’ 3. The adjective,
‘lean;’ and 4. ‘lanky’ are also members of
this family. 5. To ‘linger,’ i.e. to remain a <em>long</em>
time in a place. 6. To ‘lunge;’ to make a <em>long</em>
stroke with a rapier; and, 7. A ‘<em>link</em>,’ that which
makes a chain ‘<em>longer</em>.’</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Lecj-an&mdash;to lay.</em></p>

<p>1. Both the English verbs ‘lay’ and ‘lie’
(which is to lay oneself down) come from this
verb, 2. ‘Ledge,’ a place on which to <em>lay</em> anything;
3. ‘Ledger,’ a book which <em>lies</em> on a merchant’s
desk; and, 4. ‘Law,’ a rule <em>laid</em> down.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Læd-an&mdash;to lead.</em></p>

<p>1. Besides the verb ‘to lead,’ we have from this
source: 2. ‘Ladder,’ an instrument which <em>leads</em> to
a higher place. 3. Load-star, and loadstone, i.e.
a <em>leading</em> star or stone.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>(H)lifi-an&mdash;to lift.</em></p>

<p>This is the source of, 1. our verb to ‘lift.’
Also, 2. ‘Loft,’ i.e. a room ‘lifted’ high. 3.
The adverb ‘aloft’&mdash;‘lifted up.’ 4. ‘Aloof;’ and
5. The adjective ‘lofty.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Maw-an&mdash;to cut down.</em></p>

<p>From the Saxon root ‘maw’ comes immediately
1. Our verb to ‘mow,’&mdash;as well as a ‘mow’ (a
barley-<em>mow</em> or a hay-<em>mow</em>); i.e. a quantity of
barley or hay mown and heaped together. From
this is derived, 2. ‘Mead,’ i.e. a <em>mowed</em> field;
and, 3. Meadow, a large mead. 4. Farmers still
use the word after<em>math</em>, which, with them, is a
second mowing. 5, The now obsolete ‘mo’ or
‘moe,’ as used in the sense of a collected quantity
or heap by Chaucer and other writers down to Lord
Surrey, is said to give us the words ‘more’ and
‘most’ as the comparative and superlative forms
of ‘mo;’ but this is doubted by many etymologists.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Pocca&mdash;a bag.</em></p>

<p>There are several English derivatives from this
root. 1. We find it in the word ‘smallpox’ (or
pocks), where it means little bags or holes left in
the skin by the action of this disease. 2. We
once had the word ‘poke’ in the sense of ‘a bag,’
as in the phrase ‘to buy a pig in a <em>poke</em>.’ 3.
‘Pocket’ is a diminutive of poke, i.e. a little bag.
4. To ‘poach;’ and 5. ‘Pouch’ are variations of
the same root; for to ‘poach’ is to steal game and
conceal it in a ‘pouch.’ 5. A ‘peck,’ and 6. a
‘pack’ are both generic terms of a similar meaning;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and, 7. ‘Puckered’ cheeks are bagged or
puffed out with the cold.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Scuf-ian&mdash;to push.</em></p>

<p>This root is a fertile source of English words;
we find it, 1. in our now not very elegant word
‘shove,’ that is, to push rudely or roughly. 2. A
‘sheaf’ of corn takes its name from the stalks of
which it is composed being ‘shoved,’ or <em>pushed</em> up
together; and, 3. the ‘shaft’ of a javelin is the
wooden part which is ‘<em>shoved</em>’ into the iron.
4. A ‘shovel’ is a small instrument used to
‘<em>shove</em>,’ or push into, coals, etc.; and, 5. our
‘shoes’ are so called because we ‘<em>shove</em>’ our feet
into them. 6. ‘Scuffle’ and ‘shuffle’ are only
modified forms of the verb ‘to shove,’ and express
a repetition of that act. According to some etymologists
the word ‘sheep’ belongs to this family,
as being an animal ‘<em>shoved</em>’ or pushed along in
flocks from place to place. Hence, perhaps, the
name; but this must be considered a doubtful
derivation.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Scyr-an&mdash;to cut.</em></p>

<p>From this Saxon verb come, 1. To ‘shear’ and
the noun ‘shears.’ 2. A ‘share’ of anything
means, properly, a part ‘<em>cut</em>’ off, or divided from
the whole substance; and a ‘ploughshare’ is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
part of the implement which ‘<em>cuts</em>’ through the
earth. 3. Common experience tells us that the
adjective ‘sharp’ qualifies what easily <em>cuts</em> or
divides. 4. A ‘shire’ signifies a district <em>cut</em> off or
divided from the rest of the country; and ‘sheriff’
is a contraction of ‘shire-reeve,’ i.e. the officer of
the ‘shire.’ 5. ‘Shirt’ and, 6. ‘Short’ both belong
to the same class; the first is a garment ‘<em>cut</em>’
off, and the second is a participle from the verb ‘to
shore’ or <em>divide</em>, the noun ‘shore’ meaning the
line which ‘<em>divides</em>’ the sea from the land. From
the same root comes, 7. ‘Sheer.’ Sheer impudence
and sheer nonsense mean impudence and
nonsense unqualified, i.e. ‘divided’ or <em>cut</em> off
from any modesty and sense. Besides the above,
we have the same general idea in the expression,
8. ‘Shreds’ and patches, little snippings or ‘<em>cuttings</em>.’
9. Shakspere’s ‘shard-borne’ beetle
means the beetle borne on his ‘shards,’ or scaly
wings <em>divided</em> in the middle. 10. To these we
may add ‘potsherd,’ a piece broken off or <em>divided</em>
from a pot. The words ‘scar,’ ‘score,’ ‘scream,’
‘screech,’ ‘shrill,’ ‘shriek,’ &amp;c., belong to the
same class, the leading idea in them all being that
of <em>cutting</em> or dividing; and they are all based
upon the type ‘scr’ or ‘shr.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Sitt-an&mdash;to sit.</em></p>

<p>1. This is the origin of our word to ‘sit;’ whence
comes, 2. To ‘set.’ The latter is the transitive
from the intransitive, formed by a change of the
vowel. 3. ‘Settle’ is a frequentative of ‘<em>sit</em>,’ and
expresses a permanent sitting. 4. A ‘seat’ is
from the same root; it is that on which any one
‘<em>sits</em>;’ and, 5. A ‘saddle’ is a seat on horseback.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Sleaw&mdash;slow.</em></p>

<p>1. From the Anglo-Saxon ‘Sleaw’ comes our
adjective ‘slow.’ Hence we have, 2. ‘Sloth,’ or
the quality of being <em>slow</em>; 3. ‘Sloven’ (m.) and
‘slut’ (f.), which both convey the idea of being
<em>slow</em> and negligent; 4. ‘Slug,’ a <em>slow</em> animal,
from which comes the verb ‘to slug,’ to indulge
in sloth; and, 7. ‘Sluggard,’ a lazy indolent man.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Stig-an&mdash;to mount.</em></p>

<p>This root gives us, 1. ‘Stair,’ a step to <em>mount</em>
by; 2. ‘Stile’ (A.-S. Stigel), a gate to be <em>mounted</em>
or got over; 3. ‘Stirrup’ (or stig-rope), a rope
by which to <em>mount</em>; and, 4. ‘Stye,’ i.e. a <em>rising</em>
pustule on the eyelid.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Straeg-an&mdash;to spread.</em></p>

<p>From the A.-S. root ‘straeg’ we have the
English words ‘straw’ and ‘strew.’ 1. ‘Straw’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
is the dry stalks of certain plants ‘strewn’ or
scattered about. 2. To ‘stray’ means to go
dispersedly or separately. 3. ‘Straggle’ is a frequentative
of the last word. 4. The word ‘street’
is by some supposed to be connected with this
root. A ‘street’ is a way ‘strewn’ or paved with
stones.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Taepp-an&mdash;to draw drink.</em></p>

<p>Hence we have in English, 1. ‘To tap,’ and, 2.
A ‘tap,’ the instrument by which wine or beer is
drawn from the cask; 3. ‘Tapster,’ one who
draws liquor. 4. To ‘tope’ is to ‘tip’ off beer or
spirits. 5. A ‘toper’ is one who topes, and to
‘tipple’ is to be continually toping. 6. One who
‘tipples’ is likely to be often ‘tipsy.’</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Tell-an&mdash;to count.</em></p>

<p>The ordinary meaning of our English verb ‘to
tell’ is to recount the particulars of some event or
occurrence. Hence comes a ‘tale,’ which signifies
the recounting of such particulars. The passage
in Milton’s ‘L’Allegro’&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Every shepherd <em>tells his tale</em></p>
<p class="verse">Under the hawthorn in the dale&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">has been explained as ‘every shepherd <em>counts over
his sheep</em>.’ Shakspere has, ‘as thick as <em>tale</em> came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
post with post,’ that is, as rapidly as could be
counted. From the same root comes ‘till,’ a box
into which money is <em>counted</em>. Again, when we speak
of ‘tolling’ a bell, a similar meaning is implied,
viz. the numbering or <em>counting</em> out the strokes;
and a ‘toll’ is money <em>told</em> or <em>counted</em> into the
hands of the receiver. Again, accounts are said
to ‘<em>tally</em>’ when, after being reckoned or <em>counted</em>
up, they amount to the same sum.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Teog-an&mdash;to pull.</em></p>

<p>From this verb come, 1. To ‘tow,’ to <em>pull</em> a
boat or vessel along; 2. To ‘tug,’ to <em>pull</em> with
force. 3. The noun ‘tow’ means flax which
must be ‘tugged,’ or <em>pulled</em>, asunder. 4. The
adjective ‘tough,’ which qualifies what must be
<em>pulled</em> hard. 5. ‘Team,’ a number of horses
<em>pulling</em> together; and, 6. ‘Tight,’ what is ‘towed’
or <em>pulled</em> together with force. 7. The sailor’s
phrase ‘to haul taut,’ is ‘to <em>pull</em> tight.’</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Wan-ian&mdash;to decrease.</em></p>

<p>1. We still say, ‘the moon waxes and “wanes,”’
i.e. apparently increases and <em>decreases</em> in size.
2. ‘Wan,’ an adjective which expresses thinness
or <em>decrease</em> of health. 3. ‘Want’ signifies a condition
in which our means are <em>decreased</em>; and,
4. To ‘wean’ is to gradually accustom any one to
a ‘want.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Weg-an&mdash;to move.</em></p>

<p>1. From this come the English ‘way,’ which
means the space through which one can ‘<em>move</em>.’
2. To ‘wag’ (the tongue or the head), i.e. to ‘<em>move</em>’
it rapidly. 3. A waggon (sometimes contracted
into ‘wain’) is a vehicle which ‘<em>moves</em>’ goods,
&amp;c., from one place to another. 4. To ‘sway’ is
the intensive of wag&mdash;it is to <em>move</em> strongly; and,
5. ‘Swagger’ is the frequentative of ‘sway.’</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Weri-an&mdash;to wear.</em></p>

<p>1. This is the origin of our word ‘to wear,’
in its ordinary sense. 2. From this we have
‘weary,’ the state of being ‘<em>worn</em>’ with fatigue.
3. From the same root come ‘worse’ and ‘worst,’
which are really the comparative and superlative
degrees of ‘<em>wear</em>,’ i.e. ‘more worn’ and ‘most
worn.’ 4. To ‘worry,’ i.e. to ‘<em>wear</em> out’ by importunity.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Wit-an&mdash;to know.</em></p>

<p>From the root ‘wit’ in this Saxon verb came,
in English, 1. The old forms ‘wist’ and ‘wot,’ together
with, 2. The modern word ‘wit,’ and the
expression, ‘to wit’&mdash;all these imply <em>knowledge</em>.
3. We have ‘wise’ (which at first signified <em>knowing</em>
much), with its derivative, ‘wisdom.’ 5.
‘Wizard’ and ‘witch’ are both from the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
source, and were terms originally applied to those
who were supposed to come by their ‘<em>knowledge</em>’
by a compact with the powers of darkness. 6.
The word ‘wittingly,’ i.e. of one’s own <em>knowledge</em>;
and, 7. A ‘witness,’ or one who tells us what he
‘<em>knows</em>’ about some fact.</p>


<p class="pfs120"><em>Wrid-an&mdash;to twist.</em></p>

<p>This is the source of many English words: 1.
To ‘writhe,’ or <em>twist</em> the body in pain. 2.
‘Wrath.’ When in ‘wrath,’ one is ‘writhed’ or
tortured by angry passion. 3. ‘Wry’ and ‘awry,’
i.e. ‘<em>twisted</em>’ on one side. 4. To ‘wring’ the
hands is to ‘<em>twist</em>’ them convulsively. 5. ‘Wrong’
properly means ‘wrung,’ or <em>twisted</em> out of the
right path. 6. ‘Wrangle’ denotes a continual
distortion or perversity; and, 7. To ‘wriggle’ is
the frequentative of ‘to wring;’ it means to <em>twist</em>
about repeatedly. Beside these, we have, 8. The
wrist, i.e. the joint which ‘<em>twists</em>’ or turns easily;
and, 9. To ‘wrest’ and ‘wrestle.’ 10. To ‘wrench.’
These are all modes of <em>twisting</em>. 11. To ‘wreathe’
is to <em>twist</em> or twine together, and, 13. A ‘wrinkle’
denotes a distortion of a smooth surface.</p>

<span class="fs40">LATIN AND FRENCH WORDS.</span></h2>


<h3><em>Latin Roots.</em></h3>

<p class="noindent">English words which indicate mental actions, feelings,
or general abstractions, come to us from a
Latin or a French source. These, though not the
most numerous, comprise a very considerable portion
of the English language. It must be understood
that French is, in the main, composed of
Latin words; and we may conveniently divide this
portion of the English language into three classes:&mdash;1.
Words derived directly from Latin; 2. Words
derived indirectly from Latin, through a French
medium; and, 3. Middle-age Latin words, i.e.
those formed from a corrupt Latin by the monks
of the middle ages. These last appear in French
in a modified form, and come into English still
further altered in their spelling and pronunciation.</p>

<p>I. In most cases English words of the first class
are compounds or derivatives. We have not
adopted the roots themselves, but use them only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in composition, with some particle or preposition.
For example: the Latin root ‘clude’ is never
found in English as an independent word, though
we have ‘exclude,’ ‘include,’ ‘preclude,’ &amp;c. It
is also to be observed that a Latin verbal root, in
many cases, produces two forms in English; one
containing the root of the verb itself, and the other
its participial form. Thus, the above example
will give us ‘exclude,’ from the Latin verb ‘excludĕre,’
and also ‘exclu<em>s</em>ion,’ ‘exclu<em>s</em>ive,’ from its
participle ‘exclusus.’ If we take any one of these
roots, say ‘clud’ and ‘clus’ (shut), we may find
it in modern English in a great variety of forms.
From the participial root (clus) come ‘clause’
(a part of a sentence <em>shut</em> in); ‘cloister’ (a
place <em>shut</em> in); ‘close’ (to <em>shut</em> to); ‘closet’
(a small place <em>shut</em> up); ‘recluse,’ one <em>shut</em>
out from the world, &amp;c., as well as the verbs
exclude, include, preclude, with their derivatives
exclusion, inclusion, preclusion; the adjectives
‘exclusive,’ ‘inclusive,’ ‘preclusive,’ and the adverbs
‘exclusively,’ ‘inclusively,’ &amp;c. These words
are not often found in the vocabulary of the uneducated
classes; they belong rather to the language
of books, or to the set forms of eloquence,
than to that of daily intercourse. We should say,
in common parlance, that a boy was <em>shut out</em> of
the room by his companions; but we should hardly
say that he was <em>excluded</em>. In a secondary sense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
however, such a word would be more properly
adopted. We should say correctly, ‘that such
considerations were <em>excluded</em> from this view of the
subject,’ where we could not very well use ‘shut
out.’ Again, we could not properly say that any
one was ‘included’ in a dungeon; meaning that
he was ‘shut in.’ Words drawn from these Latin
roots have a very wide application in English,
but they are confined chiefly to a mental, and are
seldom used in a physical, sense. Saxon forms
the basis of our language, and is used in practical
and domestic matters; while our spiritual
conceptions are expressed by French or Latin
words.</p>

<p>Another well-known Latin root is ‘cide’ (from
cædĕre, to slay); which corresponds in meaning
with the more familiar Saxon word ‘kill.’ We
have, not ‘cide,’ but ‘fratricide,’ ‘matricide,’ ‘regicide,’
‘suicide,’ ‘parricide,’ ‘homicide,’ and ‘infanticide.’
To these may be added, ‘concise,’
‘precise,’ ‘decision,’ ‘incision,’ &amp;c. All the latter
are derived from the participle of the same Latin
verb&mdash;‘cæsus.’</p>

<p>Again: the root ‘sume’ (sumpt), from the Latin
‘sumĕre,’ to take, gives us ‘assume,’ ‘consume,’
‘presume,’ with their participial derivatives, ‘assumption,’
‘consumption,’ ‘presumption,’ ‘sumptuous,’
‘presumptuous,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Latin root ‘cede’ (cess) appears in English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in two forms of spelling; one, ‘cede,’ as ‘accede,’
‘concede,’ ‘recede’; and the other, ‘ceed,’ as in
‘exceed,’ ‘proceed,’ ‘succeed.’ These also have
their participial derivatives, as found in ‘excess,’
‘success,’ ‘process,’ ‘accession,’ ‘succession,’ ‘procession.’
It will be seen that in all these cases
the rule holds good. <em>Cry</em> is a more household,
domestic word, but ‘acclaim,’ ‘declaim,’ ‘proclaim’
are used on more important occasions.</p>

<p>The principle of derivation by the change of an
internal vowel-sound prevailed in ancient Latin as
well as in Saxon. Thus, from the Latin verb
‘f<em>a</em>cĕre’ (to make or do) was formed ‘eff<em>i</em>cere’
(to effect or bring about), the <em>a</em> in the root being
changed into an <em>i</em> in the derivative; and we have
English words from both these sources:&mdash;fact,
faculty, facility, &amp;c., from ‘facĕre’; and defect,
effect, deficient, efficient, &amp;c., from the other form.</p>

<p>Some of these Latin roots are extremely prolific.
For example, the Latin verb ‘<em>ten</em>ere,’ to hold, produces
a very large number of English words. In
certain verbs it appears in the form ‘<em>tain</em>,’ as in to
abs<em>tain</em>, apper<em>tain</em>, at<em>tain</em>, con<em>tain</em>, de<em>tain</em>, main<em>tain</em>,
ob<em>tain</em>, per<em>tain</em>, re<em>tain</em>, and sus<em>tain</em>. To these
may be added the derivatives, con<em>tin</em>ent, per<em>tin</em>ent,
and imper<em>tin</em>ent; besides which, we have from the
same source, ‘<em>ten</em>ant,’ ‘<em>ten</em>able,’ ‘<em>ten</em>ure,’ ‘main<em>ten</em>ance,’
and ‘sus<em>ten</em>ance,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Again: the root ‘duce’ (from ‘ducĕre,’ to lead)
gives rise to many English derivatives. First we
have (through French) the word ‘<em>Duke</em>,’ which
originally meant the leader of an army. Then
come the verbs to ad<em>duce</em>, con<em>duce</em>, de<em>duce</em>, in<em>duce</em>,
pro<em>duce</em>, re<em>duce</em>, se<em>duce</em>, tra<em>duce</em>, in all which the
idea of leading is involved. To the same origin
may be traced <em>duct</em>ile, aque<em>duct</em>, via<em>duct</em>, con<em>duct</em>,
and pro<em>duct</em>, besides de<em>duct</em>ion, re<em>duct</em>ion, ab<em>duct</em>ion,
pro<em>duct</em>ion, &amp;c.&mdash;nineteen or twenty words
from one root!</p>

<p>II. A rule has been laid down to enable us to determine
whether an English word is derived directly
from Latin, or filtered from Latin through French:&mdash;‘If
the word comes directly from Latin, the only
change it will undergo will be in the ending. Thus
“actio” in Latin will be “actio<em>n</em>” in English; “innocentia”
will make “innocence;” “tormentum,”
“torment,” &amp;c. But if the word comes through
French, it will be more altered in its passage; it
will be disturbed, not only in its ending, but also
internally. Thus “populus” in Latin is “peuple”
in French, and “people” in English. The Latin
“thesaurus” gives the French “trésor,” and the
English “treasure.”’ This may be accepted as a
general rule, but it is often impossible to determine
by the outward form of a word whether we
derive it directly from its primitive Latin source,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
or take it at second hand from the French. In
most cases of doubt the probability is in favour of
the French, for there are still many English words
which were at first spelled, and probably pronounced,
as in French, and whose orthography, and
perhaps pronunciation, was afterwards reformed
and brought back nearer to the Latin type. ‘Doubt’
and ‘debt’ are still pronounced with the <em>b</em> silent;
but when first brought into English they were
both written and pronounced as in French&mdash;‘doute’
and ‘dette.’ Afterwards, when it became
known that they were originally derived from the
Latin verbs ‘dubitare’ and ‘debere,’ the <em>b</em> was
restored in the spelling, though the French pronunciation
was retained; and the same took place
with many other Romance words.</p>

<p>There are certain classes of English words from
whose outward form we may conclude that they
are of Latin (or French) origin. First, when an
English noun ends in ‘<em>tion</em>’ preceded by a vowel,
we may be pretty sure that it is either directly
from Latin, or from Latin through French. Such
words as ‘formation,’ ‘completion,’ ‘transition,’
‘commotion,’ and ‘ablution,’ are derived either
directly or indirectly from Latin. We never meet
with this ending in words of purely Saxon origin.
The termination of these was in Latin ‘tio;’ in
French they appear in ‘tion;’ and in English the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
same ending (tion) is adopted. This Latin ending,
‘tio,’ is, however, sometimes found in French in
the form <em>son</em>, which has thus been introduced into
certain English words of this class. The Latin
‘ratio’ gave the French ‘raison’ and the English
‘reason.’ Again, ‘traditio’ in Latin became ‘trahison’
in French and ‘treason’ in English. But in
many cases the French ending has not passed into
English; for the words ‘declinaison,’ ‘conjugaison,’
‘oraison,’ &amp;c., appear in English as ‘declen<em>sion</em>,’
‘conjuga<em>tion</em>,’ and ora<em>tion</em>, i.e. in their Latin
rather than their French forms.</p>

<p>Another large class of originally Latin words
appear in English with the ending ‘<em>ty</em>.’ These
are all abstract nouns, which in Latin end in ‘<em>tas</em>.’
This final <em>tas</em> is expressed in French by <em>té</em>, and in
English by <em>ty</em>. Thus the Latin ‘socie<em>tas</em>’ becomes
in French ‘socié<em>té</em>’ and in English ‘socie<em>ty</em>.’
In the same way, from the Latin ‘bonitas’ come
the French ‘bon<em>té</em>’ and the English ‘boun<em>ty</em>,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>In many of these cases we find two forms of the
same word, each with its own meaning. One of
these tends to the French, and the other to the
Latin, in spelling; and it may be observed that the
French has been more disturbed by contraction,
abbreviation, or inversion than the Latin. For
example, the two words ‘secure’ and ‘sure’ are
both originally from the Latin ‘securus;’ but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
former is directly from Latin, whereas the latter is
from the French contracted form&mdash;‘sûr.’</p>

<p>Another pair of these double forms may be
found in ‘hospital’ and ‘hôtel.’ The Latin
‘hospes’ signified either a ‘host’ or a guest, i.e.
the entertainer or the entertained. From ‘hospitalis’
came the contracted French form ‘hôtel,’ in
the sense of a house where guests or travellers are
entertained, as distinguished from ‘hôpital,’ where
invalids are taken care of. From the French both
these words came into English, each retaining its
original meaning.</p>

<p>This principle of a divided meaning is also seen
in ‘persecute’ and ‘pursue,’ the latter of which
was known in English before we became acquainted
with the former. ‘Pursue’ is from the French
‘poursuivre,’ and is used in the general sense of
following after eagerly. ‘Persecute,’ from the
Latin ‘persecutus,’ the participle of ‘persĕqui,’ is
distinguished from ‘pursue’ by the meaning of
‘to follow after with an intent to injure.’</p>

<p>Two other words of this class are ‘superficies’
and ‘surface.’ The former is pure Latin; and is
compounded of ‘super,’ ‘upon,’ and ‘facies,’ a face.
But this word is only used in a scientific or mathematical
sense; whereas ‘surface’ has a more
general signification, and means whatever we can
see of the outside of any material substance.</p>

<p>We find a similar difference of meaning, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
as form, between ‘potion’ and ‘poison.’ Both
these came originally from the Latin ‘potare,’ to
drink. The former is the direct Latin, the latter
the French form, and both are now English.
But the second denotes a species of the first; for
‘poison,’ as is well known, is that species of
‘potion’ which destroys life.</p>

<p>This power of dividing a word into two meanings
is not peculiar to English; for many instances
of it may be found in German, French, and Italian.
But it is of great advantage. It has the effect of
providing a large number of terms to express
shades of thought by slight differences of meaning,
and it thus materially assists in making language
a more perfect exponent of human thought.</p>

<p>The following list exhibits some of these double
forms:&mdash;</p>

<p>III. The third division of this class consists of
Low Latin, or, as they are sometimes called,
‘monkish Latin’ words. These have their origin in
classical Latin; but they are all corruptions of that
language, and were formed at a time when it had
fallen into decay. To this division belong such
English words as ‘chance,’ ‘esquire,’ ‘ewer’,
‘forest,’ ‘justle,’ ‘manage,’ ‘noise,’ ‘noon,’ ‘pillage,’
‘rear,’ &amp;c. In all these we may recognise a
Latin origin, though the words themselves were
unknown to the ancient Romans.</p>

<p>From the Greek verb ‘βάλλειν,’ to cast, probably
came the Italian ‘ballo,’ the French ‘bal,’
and the English ‘ball.’ Playing at ball was, in
the middle ages, often associated with <em>singing</em> and
dancing. Hence the Romance word ‘ballare,’ and
the Old Spanish ‘ballar,’ which both meant ‘to
sing.’ The French ‘ballade’ and the English
‘ballad’ may be thus accounted for. Apropos of
‘ball,’ it may be here noted that the word ‘bull,’
as in the ‘Pope’s bull,’ is derived from ‘bulla,’ the
Latin for ‘ball.’ It was the custom, in the middle
ages, after writing any document or letter, to
affix to it a seal in the form of a ‘ball,’ so that the
Pope’s ‘bull’ really means the Pope’s ‘ball.’</p>

<p>Our word ‘chance’ was in old French ‘chéance,’
from ‘cheoir.’ These are all from the Latin verb
‘cadĕre,’ to fall (out) or happen. The French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
adjective ‘méchant’ is derived from the old participle
‘més-chéant,’ from ‘més-choir,’ to fall out
badly or unluckily. We have not adopted this
adjective, but our noun ‘mischance’ may be
traced to this source.</p>

<p>A curious case of a modern term derived from
compound Latin roots may be found in our word
‘squire.’ This is made up of the Latin ‘scutum,’
a shield, and ‘fero,’ I bear. Hence ‘scutifer,’ a
middle-age word, meant a shield-bearer, i.e. one
who attended on the knight, and carried his
shield. In old French, ‘scutifer’ was softened
into ‘escuyer,’ or ‘écuyer;’ and it afterwards
appeared in English as ‘esquire,’ or ‘squire.’</p>

<p>The old French for ‘water’ was ‘aigue,’ from
the Latin ‘aqua.’ From this was formed the
word ‘aiguière,’ a water-vessel; and this is the
origin of our English word ‘ewer,’as in ‘cream-ewer.’</p>

<p>Of the same class is the word ‘forest.’ This
did not exist in ancient Latin, but sprang up in
later ages. The monks made the word ‘foresta’
out of the Latin ‘foras,’ abroad, or out of doors;
the same root which produced the English words
‘foreign,’ and ‘foreigner,’ one who comes from
abroad. The monkish Latin form was ‘foresta,’
the French ‘forêt,’ and the English ‘forest.’</p>

<p>Under this head may be also placed ‘comfort’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and ‘courage.’ The former of these is well known
to be peculiarly English, and there is no word in
any of the continental languages which exactly
translates it. True, the French are beginning to
use the word ‘comfortáble;’ but it may be fairly
doubted whether it realises with them the same
idea as with us. It has evidently a Latin element;
and the second syllable is, no doubt, derived from
the Latin ‘fortis,’ strong. So that, what ‘comforts’
would, in the first instance, probably mean,
what strengthens, and would especially apply
to ‘creature-comforts’&mdash;food or drink, which
strengthens the body. Afterwards it would be
used in a secondary and more extended sense.</p>

<p>The Italian word ‘coraggio’ is derived from
‘core,’ as the French ‘courage’ comes from
‘cœur;’ both these being originally from the
Latin ‘cor,’ the heart. From French the word
‘courage’ has passed into English, where the
spelling is the same, though it is somewhat differently
pronounced. But neither ‘comfort’ nor
‘courage’ is found in classical Latin.</p>

<p>The word ‘contrada’ in Italian and Provençal
came into French in the form ‘contrée,’ and
into English as ‘country.’ It is derived from the
Latin preposition ‘contra,’ against; and means,
properly, the part of the land which lies <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'over-against us'">over&mdash;<em>against</em>&mdash;us</ins>.
But the word is altogether of modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
manufacture. (Compare the German ‘Gegenstand,’
where the meaning is precisely the same.)</p>

<p>The Latin preposition ‘juxta’ has given rise to
several words, both French and English, which
did not exist in ancient Latin. The French ‘joust,’
a combat in which the antagonists rushed at, or
pushed <em>close to</em>, one another, is one of these. Also
‘ajouter,’ to add or put one thing <em>close</em> to another.
From these we have, in English, the adverb ‘just,’
as in the phrase ‘just now,’ i.e. <em>close</em> to the present
time; and also the verb ‘to adjust,’ i.e. to place
things <em>close to</em> each other. ‘To justle,’ or ‘jostle,’
is a frequentative verb, formed from the above
adverb ‘just.’</p>

<p>The word ‘danger’ is composed of two Latin
roots: ‘damn-um,’ loss, and ‘ger-o,’ I bear;
these produced the Low Latin word ‘domigerium.’
This was afterwards corrupted and softened
into the French ‘danger,’ and in that form
passed into English.</p>

<p>Our word ‘manage’ is from the Latin ‘manus,’
a hand, through the French ‘main.’ There was
a Low Latin word, ‘managerium,’ which meant
occupation or actual possession, in the sense of
holding in the hand. Thence the word was transferred
to the furniture requisite for the occupation
of a house, and, in the shape of the French ‘ménage,’
to the household of the occupier. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
identity of this word with the English ‘manage’
may be seen in the expression ‘bon mesnagier,’
one who understands how to conduct a household&mdash;a
good manager.</p>

<p>From the Latin ‘manēre,’ to remain, or dwell,
are derived the French ‘maison’ and the corresponding
English ‘mansion;’ and from the same
source come the English words ‘manse,’ the clergyman’s
dwelling-house, and ‘manor,’ the lord’s
dwelling-house.</p>

<p>From ‘minutus,’ the Latin participle of the
verb ‘minuo,’ come the English adjective ‘minúte’
and the noun ‘mínute.’ Properly ‘minuto primo’
was, in Italian, the first division of the hour;
‘minuto secondo’ was the <em>second</em>, and ‘minuto
terzo’ the <em>third</em> division; which is, in French,
‘<em>tierce</em>,’ i.e. the sixtieth part of a second. The
English word ‘mite’ is only a contraction of
minute&mdash;it is a minute insect; and a ‘minuet’ is
a dance with <em>short</em> steps.</p>

<p>‘Noisome’ and ‘annoy’ are derived from the
Latin ‘nocēre,’ to hurt or injure; whence it may
be conjectured also comes ‘noise,’ as being something
that annoys, as a stir, wrangle, or brawl.</p>

<p>The word ‘peel’ means the rind of fruit or the
bark of a stick. This is from the Latin ‘pellis,’
skin, from which comes the French ‘peau.’ The
radical sense of this word is, that which is stripped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
off, or <em>pilled</em>. ‘Pillage’ is a derivative of ‘pill,’
or ‘peel.’ It means a collection of things stripped
off, or plundered.</p>

<p>The English word ‘palm’ (of the hand) is from
the Greek παλάμη, through the Latin ‘palma.’
A certain tree is called a palm because of its broad
spreading leaves, which resemble the palm of the
hand; and a palmer was formerly a pilgrim carrying
a palm-branch in his hand, in sign of his
expedition to the Holy Land.</p>

<span class="fs40">OLD AND NEW WORDS.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">One very interesting point in the study of language
is the cause of the introduction of new,
and the falling off of old, words. It is to be
observed that a new word is generally ushered in
with a sort of parade&mdash;a flourish of trumpets;
many writers make a rush at it, and drag it in,
whether applicable or not. Its novelty is attractive;
and it is often used in a sense which really
does not belong to it. But it is not every word
thus introduced that maintains its place: it is
often found, after all, that it has more sound than
sense, and is rather ornamental than useful; and
then it is sure to fall into neglect, dies away, and
is heard of no more. On the other hand, in the
natural course of things, many words which have
done good service, and for a long period, are at
length discontinued, and give way to new, and
sometimes more useful, terms. These slip out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the language unperceived; they are no longer
wanted&mdash;no one enquires for them; some new and
more expressive terms push them out, and they
are consigned to oblivion.</p>

<p>It is quite ludicrous to observe how strangely
uneducated or illiterate people use words which,
to them, are quite new. They are so fascinated
with their novelty, or, perhaps, with their sound
and length, that they apply them in all manner of
odd and eccentric meanings. Two of these words&mdash;‘promiscuous’
and ‘immaterial’&mdash;seem to be great
favourites with a certain class: an ignorant
Englishman somehow imagines that the word
‘immaterial’ conveys a sort of reproach, and he
insults his fellow-workman by calling him an
‘<em>immaterial</em>,’ meaning that he is a fellow of no
worth or respectability. The word ‘promiscuous’
is often used by the lower orders in the same loose
way. A witness in a trial, not long ago, stated
that ‘he met the prisoner “promiscuously” (or,
as he pronounced it, ‘permiskously’) in the
streets;’ meaning, by chance, or casually.</p>

<p>If we trace the history of the English language
through the various phases of its career, from its
earliest up to its present condition, we shall
find that it has been continually growing more
Romance and less Saxon. It is said that a process
of decay had set in even before the introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of Anglo-Saxon into England&mdash;that the language
had already lost some of its inflections; and it is
well known that, in process of time, these endings,
with some few exceptions, wholly disappeared.
Again, at a later period, many Saxon nouns which
had formed their plurals in <em>en</em> rejected this form,
and adopted the Romance (or French) plural-ending,
<em>s</em>. At one time, the word ‘eye’ formed
its plural ‘eyne,’ or ‘eyen;’ ‘tree’ made ‘treen;’
‘shoe,’ ‘shoon;’ and even the Romance word
‘uncle,’ ‘unclen.’ These forms have now all
departed, and in their place we have ‘eye<em>s</em>,’
‘tree<em>s</em>,’ ‘shoe<em>s</em>,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>The mode of forming a plural by a change of
the internal vowel, which was common in Saxon
nouns, has now almost vanished from the language.
We have some few left; but not more
than five or six examples, as ‘tooth,’ ‘goose,’
‘foot,’ ‘man,’ ‘woman,’ and ‘mouse.’ We may
be quite confident that any new nouns brought
into English will form their plurals by the French,
and not the German, system.</p>

<p>Again, verbs of strong conjugation are much
fewer than formerly. Many verbs now form the
past tense by adding <em>d</em> or <em>ed</em> to the present which,
in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, changed the
internal vowel-sound for that purpose. To ‘climb’
formerly made ‘clomb’ (a form used by Milton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
in the seventeenth century); ‘quake’ made
‘quoke;’ ‘laugh,’ ‘lofe;’ ‘reach,’ ‘raught;’ and
many others. All these now adopt the weak form
of conjugation, and form the past tense by adding
<em>d</em> or <em>ed</em> to the root of the verb: ‘climb-<em>ed</em>,’
‘laugh-<em>ed</em>,’ ‘reach-<em>ed</em>,’ ‘quak-<em>ed</em>,’ &amp;c. And so it
will be with all verbs that may be hereafter
brought into the language; they will, one and all,
form the past tense by adding <em>ed</em>.</p>

<p>But not only have we lost these Saxon characteristics:
whole lists of Saxon words have disappeared
which once did good service in the
language. This may be easily shown by glancing
over a few pages of Chaucer or Mandeville, where
we shall find a multitude of terms which have
been long disused. For example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="90%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">clepen</td><td class="tdl">to call</td><td class="bl"></td><td class="tdl">sterve</td><td class="tdl">to die</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">stound</td><td class="tdl">moment</td><td class="bl"></td><td class="tdl">reden</td><td class="tdl">to advise, &amp;c.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="noindent">Even in Shakspere and Milton we may find
many words which are now obsolete. All these,
again, are Saxon; so that it may be truly said
that our losses have been Saxon, whilst our
additions have been all Romance, i.e. Latin or
French.</p>

<p>In most cases substitutions have been made;
but we shall always find that the disused word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was Saxon, while the one substituted for it is
French or Latin. Thus, for the Saxon compound
‘monath-seoc’ (month sick) we now have ‘lunatic;’
instead of ‘waeter-adl’ (water-illness), we
have ‘dropsy.’ The old Anglo-Saxon ‘eorth-gemet’
(earth-measure) has given way to the
Greek ‘geometry;’ and the Saxon ‘witena-gemot’
(meeting of wise men), has been transformed
into the French ‘parliament.’</p>

<p>In all probability it was the influence of the
Norman conquest that assisted this tendency to
substitute single terms for compound words.
The French language not being favourable to
such formations, after a time pushed out many
Saxon compounds; and yet, in point of clearness,
power, and feeling, the Saxon words were far
more effective. Their separate parts were significant,
and familiar to the commonest understanding;
whereas the new word was, of course, at
first altogether foreign, and even after a time
was far from being so impressive as the other.
For example, the meaning of the Anglo-Saxon
noun ‘<em>sige-beacan</em>’ must have been clear to the
most uneducated mind: ‘sige’ is ‘victory,’ and
‘beacan’ is ‘sign;’ that is, ‘victory-sign.’ Now,
for this was substituted ‘trophy,’ which, being a
more uncommon word, does not explain itself as
the other, and is, therefore, not so vivid or picturesque.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Again, ‘<em>heah-setl</em>’ is translated into
‘throne.’ In the former word we have two
distinct ideas, ‘high’ and ‘seat,’ both familiar to
the most illiterate peasant; whereas the word
‘throne,’ though now common enough, must at
first have puzzled the people considerably.</p>

<p>One very expressive Saxon word, ‘<em>wanhope</em>,’
has disappeared from the language. This may be
considered a real loss; ‘wanhope’ expressed that
condition of the mind in which we have not
actually lost all hope, but when it is beginning to
<em>wane</em>, i.e. grow gradually less, and we feel it
slipping away from us. ‘Hope’ and ‘despair’
are the two opposite ends of the scale, and ‘wanhope’
formerly expressed an intermediate state of
mind. This was a beautiful word, and we have
now no equivalent for it.</p>

<p>A host of Saxon derivatives have also vanished
from the language which were once in common
use; and among them may be named those having
the prefix ‘<em>for</em>.’ We still retain the words ‘forbear,’
‘forbid,’ ‘forget,’ ‘forgive,’ ‘forlorn,’ and ‘forswear;’
but in the writings of the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries we often meet with ‘forfend,’
‘fordrive,’ ‘forsay,’ ‘forspend,’ ‘forwither,’ ‘forwaste,’
&amp;c., all of which are now dead and buried.
One word of this class survives, though in a different
form, viz. the Saxon verb ‘fordon.’ This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
verb, though given up, may be still seen in the
familiar expression ‘<em>to do for</em>.’</p>

<p>This tendency towards raising the French at
the expense of the Saxon portion of English
may be accounted for by various circumstances of
our history. First, there can be no doubt that the
Norman conquest was mainly instrumental in producing
this effect. This event could not have
failed to be unfavourable to the prosperity of the
Saxon. The relation in which the conquerors
stood to the conquered was of itself sufficient to
account for it, and though the enmity between the
two races will explain how the two languages were
kept so long separated, when the fusion did at
length take place, the advantage was clearly in
favour of the governing classes.</p>

<p>Another cause of this leaning to the French may
have been the number of French words introduced
by Chaucer. The English language (if, indeed, it
then deserved that name) was in the latter part
of the reign of Edward III. only just beginning to
be formed. The Saxon element, which ever since
the Conquest had been crushed, was now lifting
its head, whilst the French was somewhat discouraged.
But the language was not then fit for
literary, especially for poetical, purposes; and,
therefore, at the very time when it first appeared
as English, a large influx of French words took
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>But this result was assisted by other circumstances.
The number of Huguenot refugees who
found shelter in England after the massacre
of St. Bartholomew added materially to the
French population of this country, and assisted
in swelling the French vocabulary of the English
language.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century the marriage of
Charles I. and Henrietta Maria of France could
not fail to produce some effect on the language
and literature of the age, and though this French
taste received a check during the rule of Cromwell,
it returned with double force at the Restoration.
The foreign tastes acquired by Charles II.
in his wanderings on the continent mainly contributed
to this state of things, and on the return
of the Stewarts, the general tone of the court and
nobility, as well as the literature of the age, was
French.</p>

<p>But this was as nothing when compared with
the consequences of Louis XIV.’s revocation of the
Edict of Nantes, in 1685. We are told by Mr.
Smiles that, in consequence of this cruel and impolitic
act, as many as 400,000 French emigrants
found an asylum in this country. It is impossible
that this could have been without effect on the
English language, and although statistics on the
subject are wanting, we may confidently conclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that this immigration considerably increased the
French element of the English language.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the style of
Latinity which Johnson adopted also led to the
abandonment of many words of Saxon origin. He
was the most weighty authority in England in all
things regarding language, style, and literature,
till the year of his death, 1784; and his numerous
imitators, maintaining his peculiarities of style,
still further contributed to the same state of
things. Add to all these influences the general
leaning of most writers of the present day, and
we shall not be surprised at the condition of the
English language.</p>

<p>When we consider the numerous and continual
attacks which the Saxon element of English has
thus sustained, we may be inclined to wonder that
there should be any of it left&mdash;that it should not
have been utterly crushed and annihilated by
these raids. But this wonder will be increased
when we find that it not only exists, but constitutes
to this day by far the larger portion of our
language. This is surely sufficient to prove the
innate depth, force, and vigour of that element;
and we may fairly conclude that if it has so far
been able to make head against these innovations,
it retains an intrinsic power to resist future attacks
of the same nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>In truth, Saxon is not so much an element as
the very basis and foundation of English. The
great body of articles, pronouns, numerals, conjunctions,
prepositions, signs, auxiliaries, &amp;c.&mdash;in
fine, all the framework and joints of the language&mdash;are
drawn from that source.</p>

<p>There are, however, some French philologists
who would have it that the majority of words in
English is much in favour of French. M. Thommerel
gives himself great pains to prove this
conclusion, but apparently on very insufficient
grounds; and M. Génin, who has written some
valuable works on his own language, says, in his
‘Variations du langage Français,’ that the English
are indebted to the French for more than three
quarters of their language! ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Anglais,</span>’ he
writes, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne sont riches que de nos dépouilles; si
l’on se mettait à cribler leur langue, et à reprendre
ce qui nous appartient, il ne leur resterait pas
même de quoi se dire: “Bonjour! comment vous
portez-vous?” Leur fameuse formule,</span> <em>How do you
do?</em> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">est volée à la France.</span>’ The tone of this
remark is pretty evident, and he surely here allows
his patriotism to get the better of his good sense;
for he certainly ought to have known that, though
our language is enriched with many French words,
the main body of English, since the fourteenth
century, has been, and is at the present moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
drawn from a Saxon and not a French source.
In the case of ‘How do you do?’ however, he is
probably right. He quotes from several ballads of
the twelfth century the expression ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comment le
faites-vous?</span>’ as then used in the English sense of
‘How do you do?’ to prove that we have adopted&mdash;or
rather, as he says, stolen&mdash;this form from the
French. It has been suggested that the verb <em>do</em>,
in this phrase, is derived from the Saxon ‘dugan,’
to prosper or prevail, from which comes the more
modern ‘doughty;’ as in ‘<em>a doughty knight</em>.’ According
to this explanation, ‘How do you do?’
is equivalent to ‘How do you get on, or prosper?’
But Mr. Wedgewood, in his ‘Dictionary of English
Etymology,’ rejects this view. He agrees here
with M. Génin, that it is a close translation of the
old French ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comment le faites-vous?</span>’ And so
the matter now stands.</p>

<p>Various circumstances give rise to new words,
which either remain in or depart from the language
as they may be found serviceable or otherwise.
One modern importation is ‘<em>Handbook</em>.’
This appears an unnecessary innovation, more
especially as we had already a word which
answered the same purpose, and quite as well, viz.
‘<em>Manual</em>,’ and which has the additional recommendation
of being a simple, not a compound,
word. ‘Handbook’ is of German origin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
probably owes its introduction to that German
influence which came in with the late Prince
Consort. Mr. Murray has largely contributed to
its popularity by his numerous and well-known
‘handbooks,’ and the word will now most probably
retain its place in the language.</p>

<p>D’Israeli the elder claims the honour of having
introduced the word ‘<em>Fatherland</em>’ into English.
This is certainly a useful addition to our vocabulary.
We had before no word to distinguish
between the two Latin meanings of ‘<em>rus</em>’ and
‘<em>patria</em>;’ ‘country’ being equivocal in sense, since
it may mean either the land of our birth, or that
part of it distinguished from the town. Here the
French have hitherto had the advantage of us:
they have ‘patrie,’ for ‘Fatherland;’ ‘pays,’ for a
territorial division; and ‘campagne,’ in a rural
sense.</p>

<p>The exact date of the introduction of the term
‘<em>stand-point</em>’ is not known, but it is among the
new words of about thirty or forty years’ standing;
and we may conclude from its form that it is German.
This word is, no doubt, an improvement on
‘point of view,’ as being a closer, and therefore
more convenient, expression. It is now in common
use, especially with writers on mental philosophy.</p>

<p>The noun ‘<em>antecedent</em>’ has been hitherto used
exclusively as a term of grammar, but of late years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
it has appeared in a new sense. It is now often
used, in the plural number, to signify the actions
and general conduct of some one whose reputation
we wish to ascertain. We must inquire, they say,
into his ‘antecedents;’ that is, try to find out what
he has been doing, who were his companions, how
he has hitherto conducted himself, &amp;c. This is
certainly a convenient term enough. It expresses
concisely what would otherwise require a rather
ponderous circumlocution. Mr. ‘Punch,’ with his
usual satirical spirit, said that it would be more
satisfactory to know something of a suspected
man’s <em>relatives</em> than of his <em>antecedents</em>!</p>

<p>We learn from Lord Macaulay that the word
‘gutted’ was first used on the night in which
James II. fled from London: ‘The king’s printing-house
... was, to use a coarse metaphor,
<em>which then for the first time, came into fashion</em>,
completely <em>gutted</em>.’</p>

<p>The first writer who used the word ‘anecdote’ was
Procopius, the Greek historian of the reign of Justinian.
He wrote a work which he called ‘Anecdotes,’
or a ‘Secret History.’ The Emperor Justinian
and his wife, Theodora, are here represented as two
demons, who had assumed a human form for the
destruction of mankind. Procopius tells us that
he wrote this work as a supplement to his ‘History,’
in which he could not, for fear of torture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and death, speak of some living persons as they
deserved. The word ‘anecdote’ is compounded
from the Greek ἀν (an) not, ἐκ (ek) out, and δότα
(dota) given. It thus means a fact not given out
or put forth&mdash;an unpublished story. Though this
was its original meaning, every one, of course,
knows that we have now whole volumes of published
anecdotes.</p>

<p>The ending ‘ation’ is, in English, chiefly applied
to Latin roots; as in ‘consult<em>ation</em>,’ ‘cre<em>ation</em>,’ ‘don<em>ation</em>,’
&amp;c. It is said that Mr. Dundas, afterwards
Lord Melville, was the first to use the word ‘<em>starvation</em>,’
which he introduced in one of his speeches in
the House of Commons, on the American war, 1775.
Here we had, for the first time, a Saxon root&mdash;‘starve’&mdash;with
a Latin ending&mdash;‘ation;’ a hybrid
formation. From this circumstance, we are told
that Mr. Dundas was ever afterwards called by
his acquaintances, ‘Starvation Dundas.’ But
whatever objection may have been made to it, the
word has now taken a firm hold on the language,
and is used by the best writers as a perfectly legitimate
term.</p>

<p>The mania of modern times for grand terms
has produced some very curious words. Tradesmen,
in advertising some new invention or
article for sale, almost always endeavour to
attract public attention towards it by giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
it an unusually grand name, generally from a
Greek source, but often a strange combination.
To take a few cases of these mysterious compounds:&mdash;‘<em>Rypophagon</em>’
Soap. This, it may be
presumed, means dirt-eating, or dirt-consuming,
soap. But, as all soap cleanses the skin, why
should this sort be designated as particularly
cleansing? Simply to sell the article. Indeed,
we can hardly walk far in the streets of London
without seeing some fantastic term of this sort
paraded in the shop windows. The hair-dresser
exhibits his ‘<em>Auricomous</em>’ Fluid; and the son of
Crispin his ‘<em>Antigropelos</em>’ Boots. These meet us
at every turn. One tradesman has lately advertised
a machine which he thinks proper to call a
‘<em>Dotosthene</em>;’ by which, we may conjecture, he
means, an instrument for strengthening the
back.</p>

<p>Some years ago the writer, walking up Oxford
Street, became aware of a fellow carrying on his
back before him a huge placard, on which was inscribed
the strange word ‘Therapolegeia.’ This
was a decided poser. On rubbing up his Greek,
however, he at length discovered that this
curious word might possibly mean, ‘an office for
the registry of servants;’ and so it turned out.
But which of the two parties&mdash;the ladies who
wished to hire the servants, or the servants who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
wanted to be hired&mdash;best understood the word
‘Therapolegeia’ is a problem still to be solved.</p>

<p>Tailors&mdash;I beg their pardon, <em>Merchant Clothiers</em>!&mdash;now
persist in calling coats and waistcoats
‘tunics’ and ‘vests;’ and as for ‘trousers,’
the word is considered far too gross for ears
polite! And what has become of ladies’ bonnets?
They are gone&mdash;departed&mdash;vanished! but they
have left their ghosts behind them, in the shape
of a wretched little bunch of silk and ribbons,
dignified by the name of ‘Head-dress!’</p>

<p>Some of these outlandish compounds are not
very intelligible. One of them&mdash;‘Orthopœdic’&mdash;is
a term applied to an institution lately established
in Oxford Street, for operating on club-feet.
The name is probably intended to raise the
establishment in public estimation, but the form
of the word has justly called forth the censure
of some critics. If this word, as seems probable,
is meant to convey the idea of ‘straight-footed,’
the third syllable should be formed from
the Greek ποῦς, ποδός, a foot, and the whole word
should stand ‘orth<em>o</em>podic,’ and not ‘orthop<em>œ</em>dic.’</p>

<p>‘Stereotype,’ a term now commonly known to
printers, and, indeed, to general readers, was invented
and first used by Didot, the well-known
French printer. This word will certainly maintain
its place in English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The adjective ‘inimical’ is said to owe its origin
to Mr. Windham, who first introduced it in one of
his speeches in the House of Commons about
eighty years ago. It is useful to mark a distinction
between private and public enmity; ‘inimical’
having the first, and ‘hostile’ the second, meaning.
But the word is not very popular, in spite of
its four syllables, and does not appear to make its
way.</p>

<p>The great French Revolution of 1789, as might
have been expected, brought forth many new
words, some of which have been adopted in
English. One, destined to become a very prominent
feature of the times, was ‘Guillotine.’ This
well-known instrument was named after its inventor,
Dr. Guillotin. How or why they made it
feminine, by adding to it an <em>e</em>, is not clear; but the
word now stands ‘<em>La</em> Guillotin<em>e</em>,’ and has secured
for itself a permanent place in the French language.</p>

<p>Other words which were the offspring of those
dreadful times have disappeared from common use
and parlance, and are only occasionally referred to
as memorials of the age which produced them.
Such are the new names then given to the months;
as ‘Brumaire,’ ‘Vendémiaire,’ ‘Fructidor,’ ‘Thermidor,’
&amp;c. When the fury of the revolutionary
spirit was at length exhausted, and things were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
brought back to their former condition, these
words naturally fell into disuse, and at last disappeared.
There were, however, others belonging to
this period which seem to have taken a stronger
hold on the people’s mind, and which form to
this day part of the legitimate vocabulary of the
French language. In this class may be named
‘fusillade’ and ‘noyade:’ those horrible wholesale
shootings and drownings of the Vendéans
which formed such a frightful picture of that
awful period. ‘Terroriste’ first appeared under
Robespierre’s administration; and the assassins of
the unfortunate prisoners in September 1792 were
termed ‘Septembriseurs.’</p>

<p>It is natural to suppose that political names
would be born with the parties which they designate.
The terms ‘Whig’ and ‘Tory’ were never
heard of till the close of the seventeenth century;
and it is curious that there is much obscurity concerning
the etymology of both these words. All
that is positively known on the subject is, that the
first is of Scotch, and the second of Irish, origin.
‘Whig’ was first applied to the Scotch covenanters,
and ‘Tory’ to the Popish outlaws who
favoured the cause of King James II. in Ireland.
It may be remarked, by the way, that these two
words, though not wholly extinct, are now much less
frequently heard than formerly. Different circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of political warfare have introduced new
terms in both these cases. ‘Tories’ became ‘Protectionists’
during the great debates on the Corn-Laws;
and now they call themselves ‘Conservatives.’
The Whigs, again, appeared on one occasion
as ‘Reformers,’ and they are at present known
as ‘Liberals.’</p>

<p>The name ‘Puritan,’ as applied to a religious
sect, still flourishes in English. It was first heard
of in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and then given
as a nickname to a party which would have even
reformed the Reformation. These ‘Puritans’
affected a superhuman purity of morals, and hence
their name. They were also sometimes called
‘Precisians,’ from their excessive fastidiousness
about insignificant matters (this latter word has
now fallen out of use).</p>

<p>The distinction between ‘Roundhead’ and ‘Cavalier’
first appeared during the civil war between
Charles I. and his Parliament. The ‘Roundhead,’
in his sour and sullen spirit, condemned all outward
ornament, and wore his hair cropped close;
thus showing the <em>round</em> form of his <em>head</em>; in contradistinction
to the chivalrous tone, the romantic
spirit, and the <em>flowing locks</em> of the Cavalier.</p>

<p>The opprobrious term ‘<em>Gueux</em>’ (Beggars) was
adopted in 1566 by the Dutch revolters against
the rule of Philip II. Margaret of Parma, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
governor of the Netherlands, being somewhat disconcerted
at the numbers of that party, was reassured
by her minister, Barlaimont, who remarked
to her, that there was nothing to be feared from a
crowd of ‘beggars.’ The party of confederates
accepted this name, and prided themselves on it;
and in every language in which the history of the
revolt of the Netherlands has been written, this
French term, ‘gueux,’ is used to designate these
malcontents.</p>

<p>Many popular authors, presuming on their own
authority, have endeavoured to introduce new and
strange terms into the English language. Coleridge,
in his work ‘On Church and State,’ makes
use of the following extraordinary words:&mdash;‘Influencive,’
‘extroitive, ‘retroitive,’ and ‘productivity.’
Bentley uses:&mdash;‘Commentitious,’ ‘aliene,’
‘negoce,’ and ‘exscribe.’ But no other writers
adopted these words: a clear proof that they were
not wanted.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb used, in his writings, several
words which have not succeeded in maintaining
a place in the language. Among them may be
named, ‘agnise,’ ‘burgeon,’ and ‘arride.’</p>

<p>Again, any subject of temporary excitement
will generally give birth to some new words. The
Indian Mutiny gave us ‘to loot;’ and during the
American civil war, we made our first acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
with ‘secesh,’ ‘skedaddle,’ and ‘stampede.’ Words
born under such circumstances may be long- or
short-lived: some maintain a place in the language,
others have but a brief existence; they ‘fret their
hour upon the stage,’ and then are heard no more.</p>

<p>We have also many examples of words which
originated in some question of passing interest,
and which, though the causes of their first appearance
have long since passed away, still remain
in our language, and do us excellent service there.
The general belief in astrology in the Middle Ages
left us several words of this class. Though we no
longer believe that the position of the stars can
affect our fortunes, we still use the word ‘disaster,’
in the sense of a calamity or misfortune.
From the same source come the adjectives,
‘jovial,’ ‘mercurial,’ ‘martial,’ and ‘saturnine.’
These express qualities supposed to belong to
those heathen gods whose names were given to
the constellation under which any one was born.
In astrological phraseology a man’s fortune is
still said to be <em>in the ascendant</em>, or to <em>culminate</em>.
Both these expressions were first used by the
astrologers, and referred to certain stars which,
when they had risen to their greatest height, were
believed to portend prosperity. The word ‘aspect,’
though now expressing the general appearance
of things, was first applied, astrologically, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
physical appearance or outward view of the
heavens; and ‘lunatic’ was first used in the sense
of one supposed to be mentally affected by a
change of the moon.</p>

<p>Other superstitions have produced words of a
like nature. The ancient Roman divination may
be still traced in our English words ‘augur,’
‘auspice,’ ‘omen,’ &amp;c. The left hand was always
regarded by the ancients as portending ill-luck;
and hence our modern word ‘sinister,’ which at
first meant simply ‘left-handed,’ has now come to
signify ‘foreboding evil.’</p>

<p>‘Its,’ the possessive form of the neuter personal
pronoun, is of comparatively late introduction
into our language. In Anglo-Saxon, the same
form served for both the masculine and neuter
possessive; thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="60%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl wd20"></td><td class="tdl">&nbsp;m.</td><td class="tdl">&nbsp;f.</td><td class="tdl">&nbsp;n.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Nom.</td><td class="tdl">He</td><td class="tdl">heo</td><td class="tdl">hit.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Gen.</td><td class="tdl"><em>His</em></td><td class="tdl">hire</td><td class="tdl"><em>his</em>.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="noindent">At first, the nominative neuter, ‘it,’ was used for
the possessive neuter, of which many instances
occur in Shakspere. See ‘King John,’ act. ii.
sc. 1: ‘Go to <em>it</em> grandame, child.’ The same
may be found in the authorised version of
the Scriptures (of 1611); see Leviticus xxv. 5:
‘That which groweth of “<em>it</em>” own accord.’ But in
this translation the word ‘its’ is not once found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Genesis i. 11: ‘The tree yielding fruit after <em>his</em>
kind.’ Mark. ix. 50: ‘If the salt have lost <em>his</em>
saltness,’ &amp;c. Milton avoids the use of ‘its.’ It
seldom occurs in his prose works, and there are
not more than three or four instances of it in his
poems. The precise date and occasion of the
first introduction of ‘<em>its</em>’ into the English language
have not been ascertained, but it was probably
early in the seventeenth century. It is said that
the ‘Rowley’s Poems’ of Chatterton was detected
to be a forgery by the presence of the word ‘<em>its</em>’
several times in the MS. Rowley was represented
as a monk of the fifteenth century, when the word
was certainly not in the language.</p>


<h3><em>New French Words.</em></h3>

<p>M. Génin, in his chapter on the age of certain
French words and phrases, mentions the following
cases:<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>1. ‘Désagrément’ and ‘renaissance;’ mentioned
by Père Bouhours as new words in 1675,
two years after the death of Molière.</p>

<p>2. ‘Insidieux’ and ‘sécurité;’ established in the
language by Malherbe.</p>

<p>3. ‘Sagacité;’ first found in the works of St.-Réal
and Balzac.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p>4. The sixteenth century was remarkable for
an irruption of diminutives, introduced chiefly by
the influence of Ronsard and his school. Most
of these are now lost; but two of them, viz.
‘historiette’ and ‘amourette,’ are retained.</p>

<p>5. It was Ménage who first used the word
‘prosateur.’</p>

<p>6. The negative words ‘intolérance,’ ‘inexpérimenter,’
‘indévot,’ ‘irréligieux,’ and ‘impardonnable’
were subjects of much discussion about the
end of the seventeenth century, and did not take
root in the language till the eighteenth.</p>

<p>7. The Abbé St.-Pierre first used the word ‘bienfaisance.’</p>

<p>8. St.-Évremond discusses the word ‘vaste,’ remarking
that it was then new, and not firmly
established.</p>

<p>9. Ronsard first used ‘avidité,’ and ‘ode;’ and
Baïf introduced ‘épigramme,’ ‘aigredoux,’ and
‘élégie.’</p>

<p>10. In the seventeenth century, the literati of
the Hôtel Rambouillet produced several new
words: Ségrais gave to the French language
‘impardonnable;’ Desmarets, ‘plumeux;’ and
Balzac, ‘féliciter.’</p>

<p>The members of the Port-Royal also furnished
their contingent of new words, which the Jesuits
of course condemned as ridiculous and detestable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Among these new terms were ‘hydrie’ and ‘amphore.’
The first appears in a translation of Ecclesiastes
xii. 6: ‘Antequam conteratur <em>hydria</em> ad
fontem’&mdash;‘Before the <em>pitcher</em> be broken at the
well.’ The second, ‘amphore,’ was used in a
translation of Horace’s ode, ‘Ad Amphoram.’
But ‘hydrie’ was not destined to live, and has
become obsolete; ‘amphore’ is still retained.</p>

<span class="fs40">DEGENERACY OF WORDS.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">One point to be observed in the nature and history
of words is their tendency to contract in form
and degenerate in meaning. A word which, in
the beginning of its career, has generally a favourable,
or at any rate a not disparaging, meaning,
becomes, as it grows older, weaker in effect and
more contracted in form and signification, and,
in most cases, falls into an unfavourable sense.
It does not improve or extend, but contracts and
deteriorates in meaning. Archbishop Trench
uses this fact as an argument to prove the perversity
and evil tendencies of mankind; and it
must be admitted to have considerable force.
Take the two verbs, to ‘resent’ and to ‘retaliate.’
The first of these means, etymologically, ‘to feel
back,’ or ‘feel in return.’ Of course, one may
feel kindly or unkindly, according to circumstances:
but we now never use this word in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
favourable sense. We are never said to ‘<em>resent</em>’
kindness or affection; but only injury, slander,
ill deeds, &amp;c. Again, the derivation of ‘retaliate’
is from the Latin ‘re’ (back) and ‘talis’ (such);
and it would naturally signify, ‘to give back such’
(as we have received). But we now retaliate
offences or indignities, and never favours or
benefits. These words were, however, once used
in a much more extended sense. Dr. South, a
celebrated preacher of Charles II.’s time, in one
of his sermons has the expression, ‘resenting God’s
favours,’ which, according to the present restricted
meaning of the word, would seem to a modern
reader positively blasphemous. But in the seventeenth
century the word ‘resent’ implied good
as well as bad feeling; gratitude for benefits received
as well as anger for injury done.</p>

<p>This tendency to degenerate will appear, perhaps,
more evidently if we inquire into the original
source of certain English words which are now
used as the strongest terms of reproach in the
language. Among these may be named, ‘<em>thief</em>,’
‘<em>villain</em>,’ and ‘<em>vagabond</em>.’</p>

<p>The first is of Saxon origin. ‘<em>Theow</em>’ was a
term originally applied to one of the servile
classes of the Anglo-Saxon population, and in its
first sense implied no reproach. But, as people in
this position had many temptations to fraud and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
deceit, the word at length came to have its modern
signification; i.e. it degenerated into the present
meaning of ‘thief.’</p>

<p>‘<em>Villanus</em>’ was, in Latin, first used in the sense
of a farm-servant; but as those in this capacity
acquired a bad reputation by their immorality and
brutal violence, the whole class was stigmatised;
and thus the word ‘villain’ now conveys, as every
one knows, a very different sense from that of
farm-servant.</p>

<p>There is no particular reproach conveyed in the
etymology of ‘<em>vagabond</em>.’ It meant at first simply
a wanderer. But as the habits of a wanderer
are likely to become unsteady, irregular, and reckless,
this term, in course of time, degenerated
into its present acceptation. It is now always associated
with the ideas of a loose morality and
want of sobriety.</p>

<p>‘<em>Prejudice</em>’ is another of those words which
have gradually got rid of their favourable meaning,
and are, in most cases, used in a bad sense.
It is true, we sometimes say ‘prejudiced <em>in favour</em>
of’ some person or thing; but, without this specification,
there is always a leaning towards the bad
sense of the word. And yet the derivation shows
simply, ‘a <em>judgment</em> formed <em>before</em> sufficient reflection,’
whether favourable or otherwise.</p>

<p>In the same class may be placed ‘<em>animosity</em>.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
In Latin, ‘animosus’ meant courageous, full of
soul, vigour, and ardour. Now, it is wholly confined
to the sense of a violent feeling of anger,
hatred, and resentment. In fine, it has lost all its
beauty. There is no longer the least trace of anything
noble in the word ‘animosity.’</p>

<p>The words ‘<em>simple</em>’ and ‘<em>simplicity</em>’ still retain
something of their original charm, but it is much
to be feared that they are more frequently used
in a contemptuous sense. We speak of a ‘simple’
fellow, as of one who is easily cheated or duped;
one wanting in shrewdness; anything but ‘<em>knowing</em>;’
which, by the way, is another term which has
degenerated into an unfavourable acceptation.</p>

<p>It may seem strange, but it is certainly true,
that the word ‘<em>good</em>’ which is naturally associated
with everything high, pure, and noble, both in
morals and intellect, has partaken of this general
tendency downwards, and is often used in the
sense of ‘able to pay,’ or ‘having sufficient
means to discharge’ debts. This use of the word
is found in the language as far back as Shakspere’s
time. In the ‘Merchant of Venice,’
Shylock says to Bassanio:&mdash;‘Antonio is a <em>good</em>
man?’ and when Bassanio asks him ‘if he has
heard any imputation to the contrary,’ he replies:&mdash;‘My
meaning in saying he is a <em>good</em> man, is
to have you understand me that he is sufficient.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
This is still the common acceptation of the word
with city men; with them, a <em>good</em> man is one who
has a large balance at his banker’s.</p>

<p>If we look into the original meaning of the
word ‘<em>cunning</em>,’ we shall find that it was not at
first used in its present bad sense. This is one of
a numerous Saxon family, based upon the type
‘<em>kn</em>’ or ‘<em>cn</em>;’ as ‘ken,’ ‘know,’ ‘can,’ ‘king,’
‘cunning,’ &amp;c. We find in Psalms cxxxvii. 5:&mdash;‘If
I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand
forget her “cunning,”’ where the word is used for
skill or art. This meaning is now seldom applied,
while the word has kept its sense of deceit or
slyness.</p>

<p>The same may be said of ‘<em>craft</em>.’ It had at first
a good as well as a bad sense. It meant ability or
dexterity, as well as fraud or artifice. Now its
bad meaning is in the ascendant. If the favourable
sense is sometimes intended, this is the exception,
not the rule.</p>

<p>Indeed, there are many English words which,
though not taken in a positively unfavourable
sense, have yet a tendency that way&mdash;which
require qualifying, if we wish them to be understood
favourably. For instance, if we speak of
any one’s ‘<em>curiosity</em>,’ meaning that he has an inquiring
spirit, it will be necessary to explain that we
mean a well-directed, and not a prying, impertinent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
curiosity; for, without that explanation, it
will be certainly understood in the latter sense.
In fine, when there are two meanings to a word,
a right and a wrong, the evil is sure to prevail.</p>

<p>The words ‘<em>critic</em>’ and ‘<em>criticise</em>’ are in precisely
the same condition. These words do not of
necessity imply fault-finding. A critic is simply
a judge; he may have to praise as well as to
blame; but every one knows full well that to
‘criticise’ is generally looked upon as synonymous
with ‘to censure,’ and, unless qualified, is sure to
be understood in the latter sense.</p>

<p>In the very copious vocabulary of words which
have ‘fallen from their high estate,’ or undergone
a pernicious transformation, may be also ranged
the word ‘<em>fellow</em>.’ In some cases it retains a
certain respectability, as when we speak of the
‘Fellow of a college.’ Shakspere makes Hamlet
say of Yorick, the jester:&mdash;‘He was a “fellow”
of infinite jest,’ where the sense is certainly not
intended to be disparaging. But now-a-days ‘fellow’
is, on the whole, not looked upon very
favourably. It is suggestive of recklessness and
disorderly conduct, and, unless qualified, is not a
very complimentary term.</p>

<p>As to the word ‘<em>knave</em>,’ it is irrecoverably lost.
It is the lowest and most degrading term we can
apply as a reproach and an insult; and yet it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
meant originally nothing more than ‘boy,’ as
‘Knabe’ does to this day in German. By what process
the ‘boy’ became a ‘knave’ may be a speculation,
but the word has obviously lost its former
good name.</p>

<p>This perversity of human nature in turning
words into an opposite and unfavourable meaning
may also be seen in many familiar and every-day
forms of speech. It is not uncommon to hear an
abandoned fellow spoken of as a ‘precious’ scoundrel,
or some absurdity referred to as ‘blessed’
nonsense. This perversion is not confined to English.
The French often use the word ‘sacré’ in
a sense diametrically opposed, to ‘holy,’ a meaning
which existed in Latin, from which French is
derived. Virgil’s ‘auri “<em>sacra</em>” fames’ is properly
translated ‘<em>accursed</em> lust for gold.’ The
Latin ‘altus’ also conveyed the distinct and
opposite meanings of ‘high’ and ‘deep.’</p>

<p>Also the English word ‘silly’ has degenerated
from ‘selig,’ which in German preserves its meaning
of ‘blessed;’ and ‘ninny’ took its origin from
the Spanish ‘niño,’ where it means simply ‘a child.’</p>

<p>Another example of a change for the worse may
be seen in the word ‘prevent.’ The Church Service
gives us this word in the literal sense of ‘to go
before, or guide:’ ‘<em>Prevent</em> us, O Lord, in all our
doings,’ &amp;c.; and in the Collect for the 17th Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
after Trinity:&mdash;‘We pray Thee that Thy grace
may always “<em>prevent</em>” and follow us.’ But this
is not the present sense of the word; it has now
always the meaning of ‘to stop,’ rather than to
guide onwards&mdash;the very opposite of its former
signification. This, like other words, has degenerated.</p>


<h3><em>Contradictory Meanings.</em></h3>

<p>Connected with this degeneracy of words is one
very curious phenomenon, viz. that in English we
frequently meet with the same word in two distinct
meanings, directly opposed to each other.
For example, the verb ‘to let’ has generally the
meaning of ‘to give leave,’ or ‘allow.’ This is its
ordinary acceptation, but in the still common legal
phrase, ‘without let or hindrance,’ it has the very
opposite meaning.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Again, Hamlet says:&mdash;‘I’ll
make a ghost of him that “lets” me,’ i.e. him that
interferes with or hinders me, where the sense is
again the very reverse of the usual meaning.</p>

<p>The verb ‘to cleave’ is another case of this
contradiction of meaning. ‘To cleave’ may mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
either ‘to adhere to closely’ or ‘to cut asunder.’<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
When we say the tongue ‘<em>cleaves</em>’ to the roof of the
mouth, it is used in the first sense; but the
directly opposite meaning is implied when people
talk of ‘<em>cleaving</em>’ wood, i.e. cutting it into parts.</p>

<p>We may use the word ‘fast’ in two senses,
opposed to each other. It conveys the idea either
of quiet rest or of rapid motion. ‘The door was
<em>fast</em> locked,’ means that it was fixed and not to be
moved; whereas in the sentence, ‘He runs <em>fast</em>,’ it
expresses quickness of motion.</p>

<p>To this class also belongs ‘nervous,’ which
means either <em>possessing</em>, or <em>wanting</em> nerve. When
ladies are said to be ‘nervous,’ we understand
that they are weak, timid, easily frightened; in
fine, wanting nerve. On the other hand, a ‘nervous’
style is one marked by vigour and energy.
One use of the word represents the absence, and
the other the presence, of nerve.</p>

<p>When Shakspere makes Hamlet say, ‘Would I
had met my <em>dearest</em> foe in heaven,’ he means, ‘my
most hated foe.’ As extremes are said to meet, so
does this word express the extremes of love and
hatred.</p>

<p>The adjective ‘fearful’ will also illustrate this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
principle. It means either ‘affected by fear’ or
‘inspiring fear.’ The word ‘mortal’ is in the
same condition. Its usual sense is ‘subject to
death,’ but it is also used subjectively, as ‘producing
death.’ Hence the difference between a
‘mortal wound’ and a ‘mortal being.’</p>

<p>‘To look’ may be understood in two opposed
senses. When we say, ‘a man <em>looks</em> well into his
affairs,’ the word is used in its active meaning; but
if we should say, ‘he <em>looks</em> well,’ it would mean
that he appears to others to be in good health.</p>

<p>The word ‘mistaken’ also is equivocal in meaning.
‘I am mistaken’ may mean ‘I make a
mistake,’ or ‘Others mistake me.’ This perversity
appears in various forms. When we say
that a tradesman ‘<em>sells</em> his goods,’ the word
‘sells’ is employed in a subjective sense; but we
not unfrequently hear that his goods <em>sell</em> well,
where the same term is used objectively. In these
cases, the active form is used in a passive sense,
and not <em>vice versâ</em>. ‘A <em>walking</em>-stick’ does not
mean a stick that walks, but a stick to be walked
with. Nor is a ‘<em>drinking</em> cup’ one that drinks,
but one to be drunk out of.</p>

<p>This difference of subjective and objective
meaning may be especially observed in that class
of adjectives which ends in ‘able’ or ‘ible;’ such
as, ‘port<em>able</em>,’ ‘pli<em>able</em>,’ ‘vis<em>ible</em>,’ ‘leg<em>ible</em>,’ &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Most of these words have a passive or objective
sense. ‘Portable’ means ‘that which <em>can be carried</em>;’
‘visible,’ ‘that which <em>can be seen</em>.’ But
some of these convey an active or subjective
meaning. For example, ‘comfortable’ does not
mean ‘<em>what can be comforted</em>;’ but ‘<em>that which
comforts</em>.’ A ‘comfortable’ house or room is one
which comforts the inmates. ‘Terrible,’ again,
does not mean ‘capable of receiving terror;’ but
able to produce that feeling in others. A ‘terrible’
accident is one which inspires terror in the
beholders. This active or subjective meaning is,
however, the exception. Most of this class of
words are used in a passive or recipient sense.</p>

<p>Another case in which this contrariety of meaning
may be observed is in the use of the prefix ‘<em>in</em>.’
This prefix has, in general, the force of a negative;
as may be seen in the words ‘<em>in</em>complete,’
‘<em>in</em>capable,’ ‘<em>in</em>delible,’ &amp;c. But there are certain
adjectives in which it conveys a positive or
intensive meaning, i.e. the very opposite to the
negative. When we say that some one’s health
was ‘<em>invigorated</em>,’ we do not mean that it was
weakened; but, on the contrary, that it was very
much strengthened. Instead of depriving the word
of any of its meaning, the ‘<em>in</em>’ here adds force
to its positive signification. Some of this class
are, ‘<em>in</em>tense,’ ‘<em>in</em>fatuated,’ ‘<em>in</em>veterate,’ ‘<em>in</em>valuable;’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
but most of them are used in a negative
sense.</p>

<p>We occasionally meet with much confusion of
sense in the application of some English words.
We commonly say that a man <em>marries</em> a woman,
and also that a woman <em>marries</em> a man; in addition
to which, the clergyman <em>marries</em> them both. Perhaps,
as the word ‘marry’ is derived from the
French ‘mari,’ and the Latin ‘maritus,’ a husband&mdash;which
is from ‘mas, maris,’ a male, and
marks a difference of sex&mdash;it would be better to say,
a man ‘marries’ a woman, and a woman ‘is married
to’ a man; and the priest joins them in marriage.
The use of the good old Saxon word ‘wed’
would obviate all these difficulties; but, unfortunately,
it is now much out of fashion, and indeed
rapidly disappearing from the language,
though the noun ‘wedding’ still holds its place.</p>

<p>There is a tendency to contract or restrict in
meaning certain words of our language whose
etymology would allow of their being used much
more extensively. This, in many instances, seems
to be caused by that deteriorating principle before
mentioned; for, in all these cases, the favourable
meaning is ignored, and the bad one retained.
The word ‘condign’ is never used but with
‘punishment,’ though its meaning might be reasonably
applied to honours, merits, or rewards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
‘Condign’ rewards would be rewards worthy of
the receiver’s actions. ‘Condign’ honours would
mean honours appropriate to certain merits, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The adjective ‘inveterate’ is in precisely the
same predicament. It is never applied to a good
feeling, but always to some bad passion. We
commonly hear of inveterate resentment, malice,
hatred, animosity, &amp;c.; but we never meet with
inveterate love, kindness, affection, or attachment.
And yet why not? The true meaning of
‘inveterate’ is <em>what has gained strength by age</em>;
and it is clear that this quality would apply reasonably
enough to such feelings as love, kindness,
or affection. An anecdote is told of Lord Byron,
that in a letter to one of his friends, he subscribed
himself, ‘Yours inveterately, <span class="smcap">Byron</span>.’ This was, of
course, done in a playful spirit; but the word was
perfectly well applied; and it is a pity that this
example had not been generally followed.</p>

<p>In this class we may place the words ‘animadvert’
and ‘insinuate.’ The first of these signifies
literally to notice or observe (animum vertere ad),
to turn the mind to; but there is always coupled
with it the idea of censure or punishment. But
surely we may observe in order to praise as well
as to blame!</p>

<p>Again, ‘to insinuate’ is generally connected with
a crooked procedure of the mind. When people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
‘insinuate,’ the result looked for is rather evil
than good. It is opposed to a straightforward
mode of action.</p>

<p>On the other hand, certain French words have
been admitted into English in one sense, which
many writers show a disposition to extend. But
this should be checked, and these words should be
confined to their legitimate meaning. For example:
the French verb ‘demander’ is properly
translated into English by ‘to ask.’ In English,
‘<em>to demand</em>’ should be only used in the sense of
to ask as a right, in a case where justice must be
satisfied, and should not be applied to general
cases. The French say, ‘demander pardon,’ but
we English ‘beg’&mdash;we do not ‘demand’&mdash;pardon.</p>

<p>‘To <em>assist</em>,’ meaning to do a service, is good
English; but in the sense of ‘to be present,’ it is
French, and not English. We may ‘assist’ a
man in his work, or by giving him advice, &amp;c.,
but we cannot properly write that some one
‘assisted’ at a supper, if we mean that he was one
of the guests.</p>

<p>To ‘<em>arrive</em>’ is another of the French words
adopted in English whose sense must not be
stretched beyond its legitimate bounds. When
it signifies ‘to come to,’ it is properly applied;
but in the sense of ‘to happen,’ it is not English.
We may say, ‘Our friends are arrived;’ but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
we must not ask, ‘What has arrived?’ if we
mean ‘What has happened?’</p>

<p>The verb ‘to <em>accord</em>’ is constantly used for ‘to
give,’ or ‘to grant,’ probably because it has two
syllables instead of one. ‘To accord with’ is properly
used in the sense of ‘to agree,’ or ‘to suit,’
as:&mdash;‘This arrangement “accords” with my
views;’ but to say that ‘he “accorded” his friends
the use of his library,’ would be a wrong application
of the word. In the phrase, ‘according with,’
the word is a participle; in ‘according to,’ it is a
preposition.</p>

<p>The mistake made in the word ‘<em>allude</em>’ is in
using it for ‘to mention’ or ‘to state.’ ‘To allude’
properly means merely to hint at, or suggest; and
it should never be used in the other sense. This,
again, seems to arise from the idea that it is not so
common a word as the others, and it is therefore
adopted&mdash;as if the object of writing should be to
confuse and puzzle the reader!</p>

<p>Now and then, however, we meet with words
which retain their first favourable acceptation, and
have not been degraded to a lower sense. Some
few, indeed, have been ennobled, i.e. raised from
a comparatively humble meaning to a higher dignity.
In the first of these classes we may place
the verb ‘<em>to reward</em>;’ and we are labouring under
a certain difficulty in consequence of its being confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to the one meaning. We very much want a
word which would signify a just return for ill
deeds; for, though we use the noun ‘retribution’
for this purpose, the verb ‘to retribute’ is not in
common use. The verb ‘to reward’ is always
used in a favourable sense. We can hardly say
that ‘a felon was <em>rewarded</em> for his crimes.’ We
speak of the ‘rewards’ of goodness or virtue, but
not of the ‘rewards’ of wickedness or immorality.</p>

<p>Of those words which have been elevated in
meaning, we may mention ‘angel,’ ‘martyr,’ and
‘Paradise;’ all three referring to religious matters.
These are all of Greek origin. ‘Angel,’ from
ἄγγελος, was at first merely ‘a messenger;’ but it
is now used only in a higher sense&mdash;‘a messenger
of God.’ We certainly should not think of calling
an errand-boy ‘an angel.’ ‘Martyr,’ from μάρτυρος,
a witness, is now applied only to one who by his
death bore witness to the truth of Christianity.
A witness who gives evidence in a trial cannot
now be called a martyr. Again, ‘Paradise,’ from
παράδεισος, has been raised from the ordinary sense
of ‘garden’ to that of Garden of Eden, or place
of bliss. Cases of this sort are, however, comparatively
rare.</p>

<span class="fs40">PLAY UPON WORDS.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">There are, in all languages, certain words which
may be called equivocal. Such are either those
which are spelled exactly alike and have different
meanings, or are spelled differently and yet have
the same pronunciation. In most of these cases
the two terms have no necessary connection with
each other, though it has probably puzzled many
a reader that the same word should have such
a variety of meanings so distinctly different
from each other. This phenomenon may be accounted
for in English by the condition of our
language, especially its mixed nature. English
draws words from a multiplicity of sources. It
frequently happens that several distinctly different
forms of foreign words fall into one and the same
form when incorporated into English, each of them
retaining its original signification. This may explain
how the word ‘<em>light</em>’ may mean something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
that burns bright, and may also have the sense of
‘not heavy.’ In the first case, it is derived from
the Anglo-Saxon verb ‘leohtan;’ but, as an adjective,
it comes from the Saxon ‘liht,’ whence also
is derived the verb ‘to light’ (or ‘to alight’), i.e.
to come down gently. The verb ‘to lighten,’ in
an electrical sense, is connected with the first
meaning; but ‘to lighten,’ meaning to make less
heavy, is from the second.</p>

<p>But it sometimes happens that the same root
will produce two different meanings; and of this
the word ‘<em>court</em>’ will furnish an example. In the
Middle Ages, the yard or court attached to every
castle (so called from the French ‘<em>cour</em>’) was used
for two purposes: 1st, as a place for games or
amusements; and, 2nd, where criminals were tried
and sentenced. This is why a king’s palace is still
called ‘a Court.’ We say ‘the Court of St. James,’
or ‘the Court of the Tuileries,’ &amp;c.; and this is
also why buildings where law proceedings are
carried on have the same name; as in ‘the Court
of Queen’s Bench,’ ‘the Court of Exchequer,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>The adjective ‘fine,’ in the sense of handsome or
beautiful, is from the Saxon ‘fein,’ where it had
the same meaning; but, in the expression ‘in fine,’
it is from the French ‘enfin,’ and the Latin ‘finis,’
an end or boundary. Again, the noun ‘fine,’
meaning a sum of money paid as a compensation for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
a misdemeanour, is from the same source, ‘finis;’
for here it means the limit or <em>end</em> to which the law
con<em>fin</em>es the magistrate in determining that sum&mdash;‘<em>Not
more</em> than forty shillings,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>Another of this class is the noun ‘<em>sack</em>.’ In its
ordinary acceptation it means a large bag, and is
derived from the Anglo-Saxon ‘sacc’ and the Latin
‘saccus.’ Hence comes the verb. To ‘sack’ a city
is to carry off the plunder in a ‘bag.’ But another
meaning of this word is found in ‘sack,’ a sort of
wine. Here it is a corruption of the French ‘sec’
(originally the Latin ‘siccus’), dry. ‘Un vin
sec’ is what we should call ‘a <em>dry</em> wine.’</p>

<p>These double meanings have probably in all
nations given rise to various perversions and corruptions
of the language. One of these&mdash;viz. punning&mdash;has
been particularly prominent in modern
times, and has, in some degree, infected the great
majority of writers. Though the nations of antiquity
seem to have been comparatively free from
this literary vice, there are not wanting examples
of it in the ancient classics. There is a collection
of so-called jokes, or silly sayings of pedants, attributed
to Hierocles, though it is now believed to
have been the work of another hand. Most of
these would be now considered intolerably stupid;
and the only one among them that has the least
approach to wit is the story of the father who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
writes to his son urging him to study hard, as he
would have to <em>live</em> by his books. To this the son
replies, that he had been already <em>living</em> by his
books for some time, as he had been obliged to
sell them. In Latin a softened expression for ‘a
thief’ was ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">homo trium literarum,</span>’ a man of three
letters (f. u. r.); and Disraeli the elder mentions
in his ‘Curiosities of Literature’ two puns attributed
to Cicero.</p>

<p>But the true source of modern punning must be
looked for in Italy, where it took rise after the
revival of learning in the fifteenth century, and
whence this practice afterwards spread into all
the languages of Europe. In English, the vice of
playing on words infected all the writers of the
Elizabethan period. Puns are sown broadcast in
Shakspere’s plays&mdash;even Milton is by no means
free from them; and it is hardly necessary to
state that they form a prominent feature in the
drama and light literature of the present day.</p>

<p>Addison defines a pun, in the sixty-first number
of the ‘Spectator,’ as ‘a conceit arising from the use
of two words that agree in the sound, but differ in
the sense.’ Now the punster deals in these equivocal
words; and his whole art consists in using
them in one sense where we should naturally
expect another. There are in English several
classes of equivocal words:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>I. Where the same form has several meanings,
as 1. ‘Fair’ (beautiful, or light-coloured). 2.
‘Fair’ (just, or equitable). 3. ‘Fair’ (a market-place).</p>

<p>II. Where two words of different meaning are
pronounced alike, though spelled differently; as
‘son’ and ‘sun,’ ‘some’ and ‘sum,’ ‘sole’ and
‘soul,’ ‘peer’ and ‘pier,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>III. A third class is of those which are spelled
differently, and pronounced nearly, though not
quite, alike; such as ‘baron’ and ‘barren,’
‘season’ and ‘seizing,’ &amp;c.; though these more
frequently produce Malaprops than puns.</p>

<p>IV. There are also many cases in which a phrase
or idiom, consisting of two or three words, may be
used equivocally, and these may be fairly considered
as puns.</p>

<p>Of the first class the following are specimens:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse"><span class="fs120">1.</span> <span class="pad4">... beauty’s purchased by the <em>weight</em>,</span></p>
<p class="verse6">Which therein works a miracle in nature,</p>
<p class="verse6">Making them <em>lightest</em> that wear most of it.</p>
<p class="verse12"><cite>Merchant of Venice</cite>, Act iii. sc. 2.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1" />
<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse"><span class="fs120">2.</span> <span class="pad2">At one light <em>bound</em> high overleaped all <em>bound</em>.</span></p>
<p class="verse16"><cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, Book iv.</p>
</div></div>

<p>3. Dean Ramsay tells a story of a Scotch
minister who, having to preach at some distance
from home, was caught in a shower of rain. On
arriving at his kirk, he got a friend to rub down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
his clothes, anxiously asking if he thought he was
<em>dry</em> enough. The latter replied, ‘Never fear;
you’ll be <em>dry</em> enough when you get into the
pulpit!’</p>

<p>Under the second division may be placed such
puns as the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse"><span class="fs120">1.</span> <span class="pad2">Not on thy <em>sole</em>, but on thy <em>soul</em>, harsh Jew,</span></p>
<p class="verse6">Thou makest thy knife keen.</p>
<p class="verse12"><cite>Merchant of Venice</cite>, Act iv. sc. 1.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1" />
<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse"><span class="fs120">2.</span> <span class="pad10">I should be still</span></p>
<p class="verse6"><em>Peering</em> in maps for ports, and <em>piers</em>, and roads.</p>
<p class="verse16"><cite>Ib.</cite>, Act i. sc. 1.</p>
</div></div>

<p>3. A story being told in the presence of Theodore
Hook of an author who invited his publisher
to dinner, and treated him to a great variety of
wines&mdash;‘Then,’ said the wit, ‘I suppose he poured
his wine-<em>cellar</em> into his book-<em>seller</em>.’</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse"><span class="fs120">4.</span> <span class="pad6">They went and <em>told</em> the sexton,</span></p>
<p class="verse10">And the sexton <em>tolled</em> the bell.&mdash;<cite>Hood.</cite></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1" />
<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse"><span class="fs120">5.</span> <span class="pad14">I find</span></p>
<p class="verse6">The shadow of myself formed in her eye,</p>
<p class="verse6">Which, being but the shadow of your <em>son</em>,</p>
<p class="verse6">Becomes a <em>sun</em>, and makes your <em>son</em> a shadow.</p>
<p class="verse16"><cite>King John</cite>, Act i. sc. 2.</p>
</div></div>

<p>To the third class belong such cases as:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That of the lady who said that her doctor
had put her on a new <em>regiment</em>, and allowed her
to drink nothing but water. ‘Ah!’ replied some
one present, ‘that must have been the <em>coldstream</em>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Under this head also come the sayings of
Mrs. Malaprop in the ‘Rivals,’ who talks of the
‘<em>contagious</em>’ (for contiguous) countries; and who
recommends a nice <em>derangement</em> (arrangement) of
<em>epitaphs</em> (epithets), &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. It is a positive vulgarism to confound ‘<em>genus</em>’
(a class, or sort) with ‘<em>genius</em>’ (a high intellectual
power). This is exactly what Goldsmith
meant, when he put into Tony Lumpkin’s
mouth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Good liquor, I’ll stoutly maintain,</p>
<p class="verse">Gives <em>genus</em> a better discerning.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the fourth class may be placed punning by
the use of an equivocal phrase.</p>

<p>1. It was this form of the pun that Sydney
Smith used when, hearing of a boy who always
read the word ‘patriarchs’ as ‘partridges,’ declared
it was too bad <em>to make game</em> of them in
that way.</p>

<p>2. In this class we may also place Douglas
Jerrold’s well-known reply to a friend who told
him he was afraid he was going to have a <em>brain</em>
fever. ‘Never fear, my friend,’ said the wit,
‘<em>there is no foundation for the fact</em>.’</p>

<p>3. The story related of Sydney Smith, who recommended
the bishops <em>laying their heads together</em>
to make a wooden pavement, may be placed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
same category, and here the wit is quite as pungent
as in the other cases.</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse"><span class="fs120">4.</span> <span class="pad2">For if the Jew do but cut deep enough,</span></p>
<p class="verse6">I’ll pay it instantly <em>with all my heart</em>.</p>
<p class="verse16"><cite>Merchant of Venice.</cite></p>
</div></div>

<p>The instances of a play on words we meet with
in Milton are not so much puns, properly so called,
as what the Italians called conceits (concetti).
This poet was deeply imbued with the spirit of
Italian literature; and this form of it often appears
in his verses. The following passages are
examples:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse"><span class="fs120">1.</span> <span class="pad4"><em>Highly</em> they raged against the <em>Highest</em>.</span></p>
<p class="lhtm0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="fs120">2.</span> <span class="pad2"><em>Surer</em> to <em>prosper</em> than <em>prosperity</em> could have <em>assured</em> us.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>3. The same form appears occasionally in other
poets. Cowper in his ‘Conversation’ has</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">His only <em>pleasure</em> is to be <em>displeased</em>.</p>
</div></div>

<p>One form of the pun which is just now not
so frequently used is the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. ‘There’s <em>something in that</em>,’ as the cat said
when she peeped into the milk-jug.</p>

<p>2. ‘I’m <em>transported</em> to see you,’ as the convict
said to the kangaroo.</p>

<p>3. ‘<em>You are very pressing</em>,’ as the nut said to the
nutcracker, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Punning has been generally considered a low
form of wit; and some have taken so unfavourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
a view of it as even to declare that ‘he who will
make a pun will pick a pocket.’ But all this is
hardly just; for it may be easily shown that the
highest minds have not hesitated to adopt it, and
that in some writers it is a prominent feature of
their style. It is true that critics have frequently
condemned punning as a flaw in Shakspere’s
style and manner; but it should be remembered
that it was one form of that Italian tone which
coloured all the English literature of the Elizabethan
age, and from which no writer of those
times was wholly free. We surely cannot utterly
condemn any form of expression adopted by so
great a master; and though it may be admitted
that an immoderate use of puns should not usurp
the place of the higher and more important qualities
of style, there seems no good reason why they
should be wholly excluded.</p>

<p>The late poet Thomas Hood was so remarkable
for the way in which he used puns, that they
formed an essential characteristic of his style.
Though looked upon by the purist as a contemptible
figure in literature, the pun proved in his
hands a source of genuine humour, and sometimes
of deepest pathos. It is a received axiom,
that a keen perception of the ridiculous is a conclusive
proof of real genius; and this opinion
certainly holds good in his case. In him it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
perfectly compatible with the deepest sympathy
and intensity of feeling. In every form of wit
the effect consists chiefly in the novelty of the
application presented by the figure. This always
produces surprise&mdash;a naturally pleasing sensation,
especially when caused by a ludicrous or grotesque
image. But, in some instances, a pun suggests a
far higher tone of thought than the mere ludicrous:
it may be connected with or produce very
sober reflections, or even occasionally lead the
mind to a deeply philosophical speculation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<p class="verse4">... ridentem dicere verum</p>
<p class="verse">Quid vetat?</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the popular conundrum which has been attributed
to Burke, ‘What is (m)ajest(y), when deprived
of its externals, but a jest?’ this effect may
be observed, as well as in many of Hood’s puns.</p>

<p>In the literary history of all nations, we find
languages affected by various peculiarities. Of
these several, more or less connected with punning,
have, at different periods, prevailed in English,
viz. Alliteration, Rhyme, Euphuism, &amp;c. Alliteration
was the principle on which the Anglo-Saxon
poets founded their versification. This has been
called ‘head-rhyme,’ as distinguished from end-rhyme,
which is a more modern practice. The lines
were arranged in couplets grouped, not according
to the sense, but to the alliteration, which required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
that <em>two</em> accented syllables in the first, and <em>one</em> in
the second line, should begin with the same letter
when a consonant; and a different, if possible,
when a vowel. These three initial letters were
called ‘rhyming letters,’ the one in the second
line being the <em>chief</em> letter, according to which the
two in the first line of the couplet must be regulated.
These two, though they come first, are
therefore called ‘<em>sub</em>-letters.’ In a couplet, there
should not be more than three accented syllables
beginning with this letter; and the <em>chief</em> letter
must begin the first accented syllable or word of
the second line.</p>

<p>Finally: in very short verse, especially when
the rhyming letters are double, such as <em>sc</em>, <em>st</em>, <em>sw</em>,
&amp;c., there need be but one <em>sub</em>-letter. This is the
general doctrine of alliteration, invariably adopted
in Saxon poetry.</p>

<p>The following specimen of alliteration, extracted
from Rask’s Anglo-Saxon Grammar, may serve to
illustrate this explanation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="90%" summary="">

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>But though no longer considered as an essential
element in English verse, alliteration was often
employed by all our poets from Chaucer to
Spenser, though not according to the strict rules
above laid down. Spenser used it, in some cases,
with much effect, as shown in the following lines
from the ‘Faëry Queen’:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">In <em>w</em>ilderness and <em>w</em>asteful deserts strayed.</p>
<p class="verse">Through <em>w</em>oods and <em>w</em>asteness <em>w</em>ild him daily sought.</p>
<p class="verse"><em>F</em>rom her <em>f</em>air head her <em>f</em>illet she undight.</p>
<p class="verse">And with the sight amazed, <em>f</em>orgot his <em>f</em>urious <em>f</em>orce.</p>
</div></div>

<p>There is more alliteration in our modern poets
than most readers suspect; and though an immoderate
use of this figure makes it degenerate
into a mere fantastic puerility, many examples
may be quoted where it adds a wonderful force to
the expression. For example, in the following
lines from Macbeth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">That shall, to all our days and nights to come,</p>
<p class="verse">Give <em>s</em>olely <em>s</em>overeign <em>s</em>way and masterdom.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The grandeur of the effect is here powerfully
assisted by the repetition of the letter <em>s</em>.</p>

<p>But the fondness of certain rhymesters for this
figure was cleverly caricatured by the brothers
Horace and James Smith, in their well-known
‘Rejected Addresses’:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Lo! from <em>L</em>emnos <em>l</em>imping <em>l</em>ame<em>l</em>y,</p>
<p class="verse"><em>L</em>ags the <em>l</em>ow<em>l</em>y <em>L</em>ord of Fire!</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Rhyme may be almost considered a modern invention;
it is seldom met with in Greek or Latin,
and was unknown to the Saxon poets. This repetition
of the same sound at the ends of verses was
introduced into England by the Anglo-Norman
ballad-writers at, or soon after, the Conquest.
Since that time it has been regarded as one of the
greatest embellishments of poetical expression,
and it is now used in almost every form of poetry
except blank verse. There is no doubt that it
deserves this reputation, though here, as in other
decorations, much of the effect depends on the
judgment and taste with which it is applied.
Many a beautiful thought has been probably sacrificed
to the rigid requirements of rhyme; at the
same time many so-called rhymes are so unlike
each other in sound as scarcely to deserve the
name.</p>

<p>The effect of rhyme is materially heightened
when there is a real or fancied connection in
meaning between the rhyming words; such as
‘wine’ and ‘divine,’ ‘life’ and ‘strife,’ ‘fish’ and
‘dish,’ ‘lone’ and ‘moan,’ &amp;c. It is also curious
to observe how often familiar proverbs are formed
upon this principle. We have ‘Birds of a <em>feather</em>
flock <em>together</em>;’ ‘’Twixt cup and <em>lip</em> there’s many
a <em>slip</em>;’ ‘Fast <em>bind</em>, fast <em>find</em>;’ ‘No <em>pains</em>, no <em>gains</em>;’
&amp;c. And this is not confined to English proverbs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
In the same way the Italians have, ‘<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Chi va pi<em>ano</em>,
va <em>sano</em>, e va lont<em>ano</em>;</span>’ and the Germans, ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Morgenst<em>und</em>
hat Gold im <em>Mund</em>;</span>’ ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ueber <em>Nacht</em> ist
wohl ge<em>dacht</em>;</span>’ ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wer <em>neidet</em>, der <em>leidet</em>,</span>’ &amp;c. The
object in these cases was, probably, to produce a
pleasing effect, and, at the same time, to assist the
learner’s memory.</p>

<p>Another proof of the popularity of rhyme may
be found in many double terms which are evidently
formed on that principle. These, though
not often met with in the higher styles of composition,
are legitimate words in every-day and
familiar conversation, and have every right to be
so considered. Such are ‘helter-skelter,’ ‘namby-pamby,’
‘hoity-toity,’ ‘roly-poly,’ ‘harum-scarum,’
‘willy-nilly,’ ‘nolens-volens,’ ‘hugger-mugger,’
and a host of others.</p>

<p>A particularly ludicrous effect is frequently
presented by double rhymes, which properly
belong to the comic or burlesque in verse. Here
there is often as much wit and humour in the
rhyme as in the sentiment; and here, also, the
rhyme frequently approaches to the nature of
a pun.</p>

<p>Butler was distinguished for his double rhymes,
and in his ‘Hudibras’ he displays a positive
genius for comic rhyme, some specimens of which
follow:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p class="verse">By damning those they have no <em>mind to</em>.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another form of comic verse is where the
rhyme is made by dividing the word, being formed
by a similar sound in the middle syllables; as for
example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p>John Lyly, a dramatist and poet of the Elizabethan
period, is said to have originated a singular
affectation of language known as ‘Euphuism.’
He was the author of a romance entitled
‘Euphues;’ in which the ‘pure and reformed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
English,’ as he called it, first appeared. It
became the fashion with the beauties of the court
to ‘parley Euphuism,’ which was soon considered
a necessary accomplishment for every one who
had any pretensions to fashion or good taste.
Euphuism was made up of almost every sort of
folly of language combined, a mincing prettiness,
alliteration, punning, pedantry, elaborate nonsense,
and far-fetched expression; in fine, of almost
every conceivable form of puerility. This was a
mere passing absurdity, and the only remains of it
still left in the language are said to be certain new
modes of pronunciation then first introduced.</p>

<p>Language has been, like most other things, subject
to many and various abuses. Anagrams,
chronograms, acrostics, &amp;c., have, each and all,
‘fretted their hour upon the stage, and now are
heard no more.’ But the pun seems likely to
maintain its place, both in conversation and in
written composition. Let us not be misunderstood.
It is not the practice, but the abuse of it, that is to
be condemned. We are strongly of opinion that
there can be no greater pest to society than the
inveterate and professional punster&mdash;a man who
sets traps for you, who lies in wait for every
phrase you utter, to twist and turn it into a meaning
of his own, and who is continually stopping
the natural flow of discourse, and bringing it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
some ‘lame and impotent conclusion.’ But, as we
have endeavoured to show, the pun, when ‘telling’
and well-applied, is as legitimate a form of wit as
any other, and quite as conducive to good feeling
and good fellowship.</p>

<span class="fs40">CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT WORDS.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">In the order of nature, names would be first given
to concrete objects and their qualities, and to
visible acts, i.e. to those things and acts which are
made known to us through the senses. But whatever
may have been the principle which determined
the original form of these words, it is well
known that, in all languages, the same vocabulary
was afterwards used in a mental or secondary
sense. No new words were invented for the expression
of thought or feeling, but all the acts of
the mind and soul were represented by terms originally
applied in a concrete sense. In a word, the
abstract was derived from the concrete. The original
concrete sense of the verb ‘to see’ was, to take
in knowledge through the eye, but the same word
was afterwards used abstractly. ‘I see’ may signify
‘I have the proper use of my eyes;’ and may
also mean, ‘I understand or perceive with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
mind.’ A blind man cannot see in the first of
these senses, though he may in the second. To
hear, to taste, to touch, &amp;c., have all these double
meanings. There may be some words not found
in a secondary sense; but, on the other hand, a
very large number have lost their original physical
signification.</p>

<p>In English, most of the words which express
operations of the mind are drawn from a Latin,
French, or Greek source. These were all originally
used in a concrete sense, which in English is
now lost.</p>

<p>Horace, in his well-known ninth Satire, has:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<p class="verse"><em>Occurrit</em> quidam notus mihi nomine tantum.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">‘Occurrit’ cannot be here translated by ‘occurred.’
The word, in English, has lost its concrete, and
retains only its abstract, meaning. With us, ideas
or thoughts may ‘occur’ to the mind, but we
cannot properly speak of a friend ‘occurring’ (i.e.
meeting) us in the street.</p>

<p>One essential difference between ancient and
modern languages consists in the relation between
abstract, or mental, and concrete expression. The
languages of antiquity possessed a much nearer
relation to the original, primary sense of words.
In them, all the abstract had a much closer affinity
with the concrete terms from which they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
derived. The Latin word ‘spiritus’ had not only its
abstract meaning of ‘cheerfulness,’ or ‘courage,’
but also its concrete sense of ‘breath;’ whereas,
in modern languages the word has only an abstract
sense, and it is only by a knowledge of its etymology
that we can get at its material origin. The
result of this loss is most complete when a modern,
formed upon an ancient language, is no longer
in direct communication with the roots of the
words used. In this respect ancient languages
possessed a charm for which nothing can compensate,
and, when in the hands of a great poet, they
produced most wonderful effects. But the condition
of modern languages is, in this respect, very
different. Here, most of the abstract words,
being deprived of their original concrete meaning,
are, to the general reader, mere conventional
signs, wholly unable to produce that vividly picturesque
effect found in the ancient tongues. And
herein chiefly lies the value of a knowledge of derivation.
For, although a word may now have
lost its original meaning, it is of the greatest importance
that its primary signification should be
known, in order to arrive at a clear knowledge of
its exact and accurate modern application. We
commonly speak of a man ‘<em>applying</em>’ himself to
his work. To the general reader this conveys the
idea of giving his mind or attention to what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
is about; but to those who are ignorant of the
etymology of the word ‘applying,’ the picture of
the man <em>bending</em> his body to his task is wholly lost.
And not only as regards the true meaning of the
single word, but as concerns the difference in signification
between terms apparently synonymous,
this knowledge will be of the greatest importance.
The difference in meaning between ‘to instil’ and
‘to inculcate’ is to be understood only by a knowledge
of their etymology. To the ordinary reader
both these words have the general meaning of ‘to
teach,’ or instruct; but it is only he who knows
the meaning of their roots who will understand
that nice difference in the mode of teaching which
they respectively describe. The process of ‘dropping
in’ knowledge by degrees, conveyed by the
former word, paints a very different picture from
the ‘stamping in’ of the latter.</p>

<p>Some of our poets occasionally use abstract,
especially Latin words, in a primary meaning,
which they, properly, no longer possess. We may
look upon this practice as a licence which may be
conceded to poets; but we should never adopt it
in common conversation, or in ordinary writing.
Milton is especially addicted to this practice.
When he speaks of ‘Heaven’s <em>afflicting</em> thunder,’
he uses the word ‘afflicting’ in its original primary
sense of striking down bodily. The reprobate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
angels are thus represented as being hurled
down from heaven. But this is not the present
use of the verb ‘to afflict.’ It means to prostrate
as to mind or feeling, and is never used in a
concrete sense. If one man should meet another
in anger and <em>knock</em> him <em>down</em>, we should not call
that <em>afflicting</em> him; and yet this is the sense in
which the word is employed in the passage referred
to. In the same poet we meet with ‘horrent’
(for bristling) arms; ‘savage’ (for woody) hill;
and ‘amiable’ (for lovely) fruit, &amp;c. Thomson,
in his poem of ‘Winter,’ has, in like manner,
‘With dangling ice all <em>horrid</em>’&mdash;the last word, in
the sense of rough or bristling. Modern usage
does not sanction this application of such words in
ordinary discourse or writing.</p>

<span class="fs40">GRAND WORDS.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">The almost universal mania for violent excitement
and craving after novelty, which is so marked a
feature of modern society, is, perhaps, in no instance
more offensively obtrusive than in the style
of most of our present periodical writers. It seems
impossible for them to call things by their proper
names. They reject all simple words, and are continually
soaring above their subject into the regions
of the sublime and magnificent. As long as a word
is out-of-the-way, unusual, or far-fetched, it is
apparently of little or no consequence to them
whether it be applicable to the case or not. The
commonest and most familiar objects are thus raised
to a dignity quite out of keeping with their real
nature; and here, if anywhere, is verified the saying
that ‘from the sublime to the ridiculous there is but
one step.’ Everything is sacrificed to a false glare
and glitter of language, and sense is always made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
subservient to sound. Those beautiful English
words ‘boys’ and ‘girls’ are almost banished from
our modern vocabulary. ‘Boys’ and ‘girls’ are
transformed into ‘juveniles;’ ‘workmen’ have become
‘operatives;’ and ‘people’ in general are now
‘individuals.’ These ‘individuals,’ be it observed,
are never ‘dressed,’ but always ‘attired’ or
‘arrayed;’ they are never ‘angry,’ but often
‘irate;’ they never ‘go into a shop,’ though they
sometimes condescend to ‘enter an emporium,’ or
perhaps a ‘depôt;’ and when they return home, they
never ‘take off their things,’ but ‘divest themselves
of their habiliments.’ Another practice with these
writers is to substitute for single terms milk-and-water
definitions of them. With them, a ‘fire’
is always ‘the devouring element;’ a ‘man’ is
‘an individual of the masculine gender;’ a ‘footman’
is a ‘superb menial;’ and a ‘schoolmaster’
is the ‘principal of a collegiate institution.’</p>

<p>This style originated in the penny-a-line system.
It abounds in our second and third-rate
magazines, and, with some few honourable exceptions,
has infected all the periodical and light literature
of the day. The word ‘individual’ has the
merit of possessing five syllables; whereas ‘man,’
or ‘person,’ has but one or two, and for this reason
alone is rejected for the other word. But if Dean
Swift’s definition of a good style&mdash;‘Proper words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
in their proper places’&mdash;is to have any weight as
an authority, it is certainly here not carried into
practice. These high-flown terms are very well in
their proper places, but they are not adapted to
the cases to which they are applied, and therefore
they are neither proper words nor in their proper
places. The worst of this practice is, that it deprives
all the sound sterling part of the English
language of its peculiar force and significance.
Words that are seldom used will at length inevitably
disappear, and thus, if not checked in time,
this extravagance of expression will do an irreparable
injury to the English language.</p>

<p>Another habit of these periodical writers is to
sacrifice the idiom of the language to their love
for some particular word. Two verbs, of which
they seem especially fond, are, ‘to commence’ and
‘to essay.’ These are French words, and are
always preferred before their corresponding Saxon
synonyms, ‘to begin’ and ‘to try.’ But in their
liking for them, these writers are often betrayed
into an incorrect phraseology. To ‘begin’ may be
followed by an infinitive or a gerund. We may
say, ‘he began to read,’ or ‘he began reading.’
Not so may the verbs ‘to commence’ and ‘to essay’
be used. These do not, correctly, take an infinitive
as an object. We cannot say, properly, ‘<em>he commenced
to read</em>,’ or ‘<em>he essayed to do well</em>.’ In such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
cases we must use ‘begin’ and ‘try.’ But the
latter are not sufficiently elevated to suit the views
of the penny-a-liners, and are therefore rejected.</p>

<p>Another of these grand words is ‘intoxicated.’
In the newspapers, for once that we read of a man
being drunk, we find at least nine or ten times
that he is intoxicated. The word ‘drunk’ is unfortunately
too often required in our police reports;
but the reporters are either too squeamish, or too
much inclined to the long word, to hesitate in their
choice. ‘Intoxicated’ has five syllables; ‘drunk’
has but one: so that the odds in favour of the
former are literally as five to one. But even then
they are not satisfied: they add to it ‘<em>with drink</em>,’
thus putting two more syllables to the phrase.
We generally read that ‘the prisoner was intoxicated
with drink.’ This form of expression
must occupy at least a line of the printed matter,
and is therefore worth to the writer&mdash;exactly one
penny!</p>

<p>The use of the verb ‘replace,’ as frequently
seen in the writings of the periodical press, is open
to objection. When anyone (we will suppose)
quits his office, they write that he was ‘replaced’
by another, meaning that some one else filled his
place. But the verb ‘to replace’ has not, correctly,
this meaning. It signifies ‘to put back in its place.’
If I take a book from the library shelf, and, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
reading it, put it back again, I <em>replace</em> it; but I
cannot properly say that one man ‘<em>re</em>placed’ another
in his office, if I mean that he took his place.
There seems to be here a confusion between the
two French verbs, ‘remplacer’ and ‘replacer.’
The first means ‘to put <em>in</em> the place of another,’
<em>i.e.</em> to furnish a substitute; and the second is, ‘to
put back in its own place.’</p>

<p>Another common fault is the use of the word
‘abstractedly’ for ‘abstractly.’ A man speaks
‘abstractedly’ when his mind is drawn away from
the subject before him; here, his manner is abstracted.
But a man speaks ‘abstractly’ when he
treats of the ideal and not the real&mdash;the abstract,
and not the concrete. Here his subject is abstract.
Again: ‘to choose,’ or ‘to decide,’ is much too
common a term to suit the taste of these modern
article-writers. According to them, people never
‘choose:’ they always <em>elect</em>. We continually read,
for example, that some one ‘elected’ to go abroad,
rather than that he decided or determined on
taking that step.</p>

<p>Three words of suspicious length and somewhat
mysterious meaning have been lately added to our
vocabulary, viz. ‘rehabilitate,’ ‘solidarity,’ and
‘desirability.’ These seem to be great favourites,
especially with news-writers. They talk of the
‘<em>desirability</em>’ of ‘<em>rehabilitating</em>’ our relations with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
certain continental State, in order to effect a
‘<em>solidarity</em>’ between the two nations!</p>

<p>One phase of this leaning to the grandiose style
is an affectation of foreign words and phrases.
The extent to which this practice is carried by
some writers is extraordinary. They can scarcely
call anything by its proper English name, but
must apply to it some Italian or French word.
Such writers describe people as ‘<em>blasés</em>,’ or perhaps
as having ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un air distingué</i>;’ and these people
are said to do everything ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à merveille</i>.’ Some few
Italian phrases are also occasionally introduced,
such as ‘<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">in petto</i>,’ the ‘<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">dolce far niente</i>,’ &amp;c.; and
the style of many writers learned in the ancient
classics is in like manner infected with Greek and
Latin words and idioms.</p>

<span class="fs40">THE SPELLING OF WORDS.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Since, before the invention of printing, there
was no standard of English spelling, our orthography
can have no history before that epoch.
The variety of forms in which words appeared was
endless; for not only did different writers spell
them differently, but one writer would often present
his readers with several forms of the same
word even in the same page. During the whole
of our early history, then, the language can hardly
be said to have had any fixed laws of spelling.</p>

<p>The orthography of Anglo-Saxon itself seems to
have been very unsettled. Few words appeared
invariably in the same form, and some had as
many as three or four different modes of spelling.
We find ‘ác’ and ‘æc’ (oak); ‘lang’ and ‘long’
(long); ‘geaf’ and ‘gef’ (give); ‘seolf,’ ‘self,’
and ‘sylf’ (self); ‘sweaster’ and ‘swuster’ (sister);
‘heauwod’ and ‘heafod’ (head), &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>The accent also made a difference in both the
pronunciation and meaning of some words. Thus,
‘ís’ meant ice, but ‘is’ (without the accent) was
the 3rd singular present of the verb ‘to be.’ ‘God,’
in Anglo-Saxon, was, in spelling and meaning, our
word ‘God;’ but ‘gód’ (pronounced ‘gōād’) was
our adjective ‘good,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>The marked difference in form between the
Saxon and the early English was the substitution
of <em>e</em> for the Saxon endings <em>a</em>, <em>e</em>, and <em>u</em>. Thus,
‘nam<em>a</em>,’ ‘end<em>e</em>,’ and ‘wud<em>u</em>’ appeared in early
English as nam<em>e</em>, end<em>e</em>, and wood<em>e</em> (probably pronounced
as two syllables). At a still later period
there was a tendency to get rid not only of this <em>e</em>,
but of the whole system of Anglo-Saxon inflections;
and the nouns, adjectives, and verbs were
stripped of nearly all their endings.</p>

<p>The only two inflections of the noun which
survived this decay, and which may be traced to
the present time, were the <em>es</em> of the possessive (or
genitive) singular, and the <em>as</em> of the subjective (or
nominative) plural. The Saxon for ‘of a smith’
was ‘smid<em>es</em>,’ and the nominative plural of the
same word was ‘smid<em>as</em>.’ Wiclif often uses ‘<em>is</em>’
as a plural ending, as in ‘hous<em>is</em>,’ ‘barel<em>is</em>,’ &amp;c.
Caxton writes ‘thyng<em>es</em>,’ and More, tyth<em>es</em>, arrow<em>es</em>,
&amp;c. Now the usual ending is <em>s</em>; as in
‘book<em>s</em>,’ tree<em>s</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>All the inflections of the adjectives also fell off;
and instead of ‘god<em>ne</em>’ (acc. sing.), ‘god<em>es</em>’ (gen.
sing.), ‘god<em>um</em>,’ ‘god<em>re</em>’ (dat. pl.) these endings
disappeared, and the word was reduced in all
its cases and genders, and in both numbers, to
‘gód’ (good), as we now have it.</p>

<p>The verb lost its gerund, or rather the latter
was confounded with the participle in <em>ing</em>; so that
‘writtane’ (for the purpose of writing) was used
indiscriminately with ‘writende’ (writing); and
many other terminations, though they did not
wholly disappear, were weakened by the substitution
of <em>e</em> for <em>a</em>, or <em>en</em> for <em>an</em>, as ‘bærn<em>en</em>’ for
‘bærn<em>an</em>.’ Afterwards the participle ending was
changed from <em>ende</em> to <em>and</em>, thence to <em>inge</em>, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'and at at last'">and at
last</ins> to <em>ing</em>, as we now have it. Thus:&mdash;‘writende,’
‘writand,’ ‘writinge,’ ‘writing.’</p>

<p>Between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
there was a constant and increasing tendency to
throw off the final <em>e</em>. Chaucer, Wiclif, and other
writers of the fourteenth century, have numbers of
words written with that ending, where it is now
omitted, as ‘child<em>e</em>,’ ‘hert<em>e</em>,’ ‘fynd<em>e</em>,’ &amp;c. But, in
taking away this final, it became necessary, in some
cases, to make another change in the spelling, in
order to prevent a mispronunciation. The earlier
form ‘mete,’ being deprived of its final <em>e</em>, would
leave ‘<em>met</em>.’ Therefore, to preserve the long sound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the <em>e</em> medial was doubled, and the word stood
‘<em>meet</em>.’ The same principle operated in transforming
‘cloke’ into ‘cloak,’ ‘yere’ into ‘year,’ ‘scole’
into ‘school,’ ‘grete’ into ‘great,’ &amp;c. The <em>e</em>
final being taken away, it was necessary, in order
to preserve the pronunciation, to lengthen the
internal vowel.</p>

<p>The art of printing exercised a very powerful
influence over English orthography. The first
printers assumed at once an absolute power, not
only in the matter of spelling and punctuation,
but even in cases of expression and grammatical
forms. The result was far from favourable to
uniformity; for, as every printer had his own
views on the subject, each consequently differed
from the others, and this entailed endless confusion.
The author’s punctuation and spelling were
then always sacrificed to the printer’s convenience.
If the writer used any words of doubtful or unsettled
orthography, of which there was then a very
large number, the printer assumed it as his right
to add to, or take from them as many letters as
he thought proper, to suit the length of the line.
Many blunders also arose from the ignorance of
the copyists. The various manuscripts of one
poem sometimes differ so widely from each other,
that modern scholars have supposed these varieties
to have been the result of the author’s own revision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
But the more probable cause of these
differences is that the manuscript was copied by
a number of different hands, and that consequently
each differed from the other according to the views
of such matters which each copyist had adopted.</p>

<p>We may safely conclude that in orthography, as
in other matters, changes will take place. The
phonographers say that, as the whole object of
writing is to represent on paper the sounds of the
human voice, every word should be spelled exactly
as it is pronounced. But there are grave objections
to this view. First, pronunciation itself is
in a state of transition&mdash;as the present differs from
the past, so will the future differ from the present&mdash;and
therefore the spelling would have to be
changed as often as the words were differently
pronounced. Secondly, there are so many, and
such delicate shades of sound in the human voice,
that, to carry out this design properly, it would be
necessary to invent innumerable characters to
represent them. The remedy, then, would be
worse than the disease, for the multitude of new
and strange characters which this system would
require would be far more puzzling to a learner
than any of the existing difficulties.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the conservative party maintain
that the proposed changes in spelling should
not be admitted because they would obscure, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
not destroy, the derivation of words. This argument
has certainly considerable force. In the
study of English, a knowledge of derivation is
quite as important as correctness of spelling.
Surely the one should not be wholly sacrificed to
the other. Are we to lose the essence of the word
for the mere sake of its outward appearance? It
would certainly be a great gain to simplify our
forms of spelling; but if, in so doing, we destroyed
the etymology of the language, would our gain or
our loss be the greater? The present forms of
spelling are, in many cases, a key to the derivation
of the word. How did the <em>b</em> get into ‘dou<em>b</em>t’ and
‘de<em>b</em>t,’ or the <em>g</em> into ‘fei<em>g</em>n’ and ‘impu<em>g</em>n?’
These letters are left in the words expressly to
show us their origin. When first introduced into
English, ‘debt’ and ‘doubt’ were both written
and pronounced as in French (‘dette’ and ‘doute’).
But when it afterwards became known that they
were originally derived from the Latin verbs ‘de<em>b</em>ēre’
and ‘du<em>b</em>itare,’ the <em>b</em> was restored in the spelling.</p>

<p>Some argue that the influence of derivation on
spelling is only partial, and that other and more
powerful causes are operating changes in the
forms of words. It is readily admitted that the
language will, <em>in time</em>, yield to this pressure. But
we must not precipitate matters; and there is
something to be said on the other side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
question. The study of English has lately received
a great impulse, and increased attention has been
paid to its nature and origin. It is surely somewhat
inconsistent to recommend this increased
energy of study, and, at the same time, to throw
obstacles in the student’s way! It is remarkable
how long it takes to work a change of this sort.
The writer can remember the controversy about
the substitution of the final <em>or</em> for <em>our</em> for more
than forty years back; and yet in that time very
little progress has been made in the proposed
reform. But there are obviously certain tendencies
in the English language towards a new orthography,
and we may point out with tolerable
certainty what changes will be eventually effected.</p>

<p>The law of contraction is in constant operation
in the spelling of words. It is this principle that
has caused us to reject the final <em>k</em> in words of two
or more syllables. <em>K</em> final is now confined chiefly
to monosyllables. We retain it in ‘back,’ ‘peck,’
‘stick,’ ‘rock,’ ‘duck,’ &amp;c. Formerly ‘music,’
‘critic,’ ‘traffic,’ &amp;c. retained the k; now it has
disappeared from these words. But it is evidently
very loth to go; for it still holds its
place in ‘attac<em>k</em>,’ ‘ransac<em>k</em>,’ ‘bulloc<em>k</em>,’ ‘hilloc<em>k</em>,’
&amp;c., as well as in compound words, as ‘shipwrec<em>k</em>,’
‘weathercoc<em>k</em>,’ ‘wedloc<em>k</em>,’ &amp;c. It is possible that,
at some future time, we shall be writing ‘bac,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
‘pec,’ ‘stic,’ ‘roc,’ and ‘luc;’ but for the present
we must, in these cases, add the <em>k</em>.</p>

<p>The same contracting tendency affects the forms
of certain past tenses of verbs. We write ‘sent’
for ‘sended,’ ‘built’ for ‘builded,’ &amp;c. Some
would extend this contraction to all verbs ending
in close consonants, as <em>p</em>, <em>ck</em>, <em>f</em>, or <em>s</em>. They would
have us write ‘slapt,’ ‘drest,’ ‘hisst,’ ‘hopt,’ and
‘snufft.’ There is, no doubt, a leaning this way
in the language. The verbs ‘creep,’ ‘feel,’ ‘sleep,’
&amp;c. make, in the past tense, ‘crept,’ ‘felt,’ ‘slept,’
&amp;c. But it will be some time before such forms
as quafft, peept, pickt, hopt, and supt are generally
adopted.</p>

<p>This contracting principle also originated the
tendency to omit the <em>u</em> in the termination <em>our</em>.
Most of the words which have this ending come to
us from Latin through French, where the ending
is <em>eur</em>, as seen in ‘honn<em>eur</em>,’ ‘vigu<em>eur</em>,’ ‘val<em>eur</em>,’
&amp;c. American writers leave out the <em>u</em> in all these
cases. They write ‘endeav<em>or</em>,’ ‘neighb<em>or</em>,’ behavi<em>or</em>,
&amp;c. There is, no doubt, a tendency to omit
the <em>u</em> in such words. It may be observed that
most of the words which have lost this <em>u</em> are
names of agents, as ‘act<em>or</em>,’ ‘auth<em>or</em>,’ ‘creat<em>or</em>,’
‘doct<em>or</em>,’ ‘govern<em>or</em>,’ ‘orat<em>or</em>,’ ‘sail<em>or</em>,’ ‘tail<em>or</em>,’ and
‘warri<em>or</em>;’ whereas comparatively few abstract
nouns have rejected it, though it no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
appears in ‘err<em>or</em>,’ ‘horr<em>or</em>,’ ‘stup<em>or</em>,’ ‘terr<em>or</em>,’ and
‘torp<em>or</em>.’</p>

<p>Another pair of endings&mdash;<em>ise</em> and <em>ize</em>&mdash;has given
rise to a divided practice in spelling. The leaning
here is decidedly towards <em>ise</em>. The words tempor<em>ise</em>,
advert<em>ise</em>, author<em>ise</em>, &amp;c. were all formerly
written with a <em>z</em>. Strictly speaking, <em>ize</em> should be
used in those verbs of this class which can be traced
directly to a Greek source, as ‘bapt<em>ize</em>,’ ‘idol<em>ize</em>,’
‘agon<em>ize</em>;’ especially those used in a scientific sense,
as catech<em>ize</em>, symbol<em>ize</em>, epitom<em>ize</em>, &amp;c. But many
such words come to us through a French medium,
as ‘critic<em>ise</em>,’ ‘real<em>ise</em>,’ ‘civil<em>ise</em>.’ These should be
spelled <em>ise</em>. In all probability, we shall some day
reject the <em>z</em> altogether. The letter <em>s</em> seems to be
taking its place in these and many other cases, as
in ‘arti<em>s</em>an,’ ‘parti<em>s</em>an,’ &amp;c. The late Dr. Donaldson
was of opinion that all the above verbs should
be spelled <em>ise</em>.</p>

<p>By the same law of contraction it is proposed to
give up the diphthongs <em>ae</em> and <em>oe</em>, found in many
English words derived from Greek and Latin, and
to spell them all with a simple <em>e</em>. Many of this
class have already adopted the change, for we now
write ‘<em>E</em>gypt,’ ‘<em>e</em>conomy,’ ‘f<em>e</em>deral,’ ‘<em>e</em>nigma,’
‘ph<em>e</em>nomenon,’ ‘p<em>e</em>nal,’ &amp;c. But it is reasonable
to expect that many of them will retain the diphthong
for some time. Proper names and scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
terms are likely to keep it longer, whilst in more
familiar words it will, probably, give place to the
single vowel. Accordingly we may predict that
the diphthong will remain in ‘<em>Æ</em>sop,’ <em>Œ</em>dipus,’
‘<em>Æ</em>tna,’ ‘<em>Œ</em>ta,’ and ‘C<em>æ</em>sar,’ as well as in ‘arch<em>æ</em>ology,’
‘anap<em>æ</em>st,’ ‘<em>æ</em>sthetic,’ cyclop<em>æ</em>dia,’ and
‘hom<em>œ</em>opathy;’ while from such words as ‘<em>e</em>conomy,’
‘pr<em>e</em>tor,’ ‘prim<em>e</em>val,’ ‘<em>e</em>qual,’ ‘<em>e</em>dile,’ ‘<em>e</em>difice,’
&amp;c., if not already gone, it will soon disappear
altogether. There is here an <em>e</em>conomical tendency
in favour of the single <em>e</em>, and the longer these
words remain in the language, the more likely
are they to be spelled with the single vowel.</p>

<p>In many English words there has been a sort
of rivalry between the letters <em>y</em> and <em>i</em>, and the
general tendency now is in favour of <em>i</em>. This does
not seem to be a question of contraction. It is
supposed to have arisen from a dislike of the
printers to the ugly appearance of <em>y</em> in the middle
of a word. Mandeville writes ‘l<em>y</em>til’ (little),
‘w<em>y</em>se’ (wise), ‘t<em>y</em>mes’ (times); and Wiclif has
‘with<em>y</em>nne’ (within), ‘rece<em>y</em>ve’ (receive), ‘wr<em>y</em>te’
(write), ‘fa<em>y</em>le’ (fail), ‘everlast<em>y</em>ne’ (everlasting),
&amp;c. In certain Greek words, however, the <em>y</em> still
holds its place, as in ‘h<em>y</em>mn,’ ‘t<em>y</em>pe,’ ‘h<em>y</em>dra,’
‘t<em>y</em>rant,’ ‘l<em>y</em>re,’ &amp;c. These will probably long
remain in the spelling.</p>

<p>One innovation proposed by the phonographers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
was to substitute a <em>k</em> for the ending <em>que</em>. All
our words of this class are from the French,
where the ending is invariably <em>que</em>. Many of
these have already conformed to the English
tendency, and are written with a <em>k</em> final, as ‘mas<em>k</em>,’
‘cas<em>k</em>,’ ‘bris<em>k</em>,’ ‘ris<em>k</em>,’ &amp;c. These are monosyllables.
But we hesitate to extend this practice to words of
two or three syllables. We are not prepared to
adopt such forms as ‘pictures<em>k</em>,’ ‘grotes<em>k</em>,’ ‘burles<em>k</em>,’
&amp;c. Nor is it likely that we shall be easily
reconciled to ‘opa<em>ke</em>,’ ‘anti<em>ke</em>,’ ‘obli<em>ke</em>,’ &amp;c. In
some few cases, if only to mark a difference of
meaning, it is expedient to have two forms of
spelling; for instance, between <em>bark</em> (of a tree)
and <em>barque</em> (a vessel), <em>check</em> (a restraint) and
<em>cheque</em> (on a banker), <em>pike</em> (a weapon) and <em>pique</em>
(a petty quarrel), <em>mark</em> (a note or sign) and
<em>marque</em> (a reprisal) as in ‘letters of marque.’</p>

<p>We ought not to conclude, because changes of
spelling have been adopted in certain words, that
similar changes should be applied to all the words
of that class&mdash;because, for instance, the old forms
‘advaunce,’ ‘commaund,’ ‘chaunt,’ and others
now appear as ‘advance,’ ‘command,’ ‘chant,’
we should, for this reason, write ‘tant,’ ‘hant,’
‘dant,’ and ‘lanch’ instead of ‘taunt,’ ‘haunt,’
‘daunt,’ and ‘launch.’ But nature and habit are
not to be trifled with. Both experience and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
reason combat all sudden changes. If they are
to be, they will come in good time; meanwhile let
us watch and follow.</p>

<p>Again, the reformers of our spelling would have
us cut off the ending <em>ue</em> from such words as ‘catalogue,’
‘demagogue,’ ‘synagogue,’ ‘colleague,’
‘harangue,’ ‘tongue,’ &amp;c., and spell them ‘catalog,’
‘demagog,’ &amp;c. It may be most confidently predicted
that, whatever may happen in the course of
future ages, this change will not take place either
in this or the next generation.</p>

<p>Another proposed change is to invert the ending
<em>re</em>, and write it <em>er</em>, as being more in accordance with
English pronunciation. That this is the tendency
of the language is not to be denied, for it is well
known that many English words now ending in <em>er</em>
were formerly written <em>re</em>. Such are the Norman
names of the months&mdash;‘Septemb<em>re</em>,’ ‘Octob<em>re</em>,’
‘Novemb<em>re</em>,’ ‘Decemb<em>re</em>,’ &amp;c. Some of this class
have not yet adopted the change, and still appear
in their French forms, as ‘accout<em>re</em>,’ ‘cent<em>re</em>,’
‘fib<em>re</em>,’ ‘lust<em>re</em>,’ ‘nit<em>re</em>,’ ‘och<em>re</em>,’ &amp;c. But it is to
be noticed that these are not common words&mdash;not
words of the homestead or market-place&mdash;and that
therefore they are much more likely to retain their
old forms. In some of them, also, it is desirable
to have two modes of spelling. We have ‘met<em>er</em>’
in the sense of a measurer, as in ‘baromet<em>er</em>,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
‘thermomet<em>er</em>,’ &amp;c., and ‘met<em>re</em>’ in versification.
‘Cent<em>er</em>’ appears as a verb, and ‘cent<em>re</em>’ as a
noun. That most of this class will, in time, be
spelled with the ending <em>er</em> is highly probable, but
the above remark may account for their not having
yet adopted that termination.</p>

<p>It has often been objected to our language that
its study, as regards pronunciation and spelling, is
more difficult than that of any of the continental
languages. Foreigners endeavouring to master
these difficulties are often quite overwhelmed by
them, and not unfrequently give up the study in
despair. But no language is without difficulties
of this sort. Indeed, the difference between written
and spoken French offers quite as formidable
obstacles to the speller in French as could happen
in English. The French words ‘<em>ver</em>’ (from ‘vermis,’
a worm), ‘<em>vert</em>’ (from ‘viridis,’ green), and
‘<em>verre</em>’ (from ‘vitrum,’ glass) are all pronounced
exactly alike, and it is only by a knowledge of
their derivation that one can account for the
difference of their forms. Again, <em>mère</em> (from
mater, a mother), <em>mer</em> (from mare, the sea), and
<em>maire</em> (from major, greater) differ in spelling,
though not in sound, because of their different
derivations. If all these words had the same form
of spelling because they have the same pronunciation,
no one could trace them to their source or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
account for their meaning. We may, then, conclude
that the proper spelling of a word depends
mainly on its etymology, and that the reason why
bad spelling is looked upon with such disfavour is,
that it argues ignorance of derivation.</p>

<p>In all probability, if the project of instituting
an English Academy for the regulation of our
language were carried out, there would immediately
arise innumerable protests against its decisions.
It is well known that the literary decrees
of the French Academy are not generally accepted
or adopted, and that the opinions of some of the
most eminent literati in France are directly
against its conclusions. Besides, the spirit of the
English people is so strongly opposed to dictation,
in this as in other matters, that such an institution
would stand no chance of success in this country.</p>

<p>It is too much the fashion now-a-days to find
fault with English orthography, and it is also too
much the fashion to acquiesce in its general
condemnation. But, in truth, it is only those
who have paid no attention to our language, as a
scientific study, who can fail to recognise the
causes of these objections. The three principal
elements of English&mdash;viz. Saxon, French, and
Latin&mdash;have, each, and all, had some influence on
the formation of our words; and this will account
for the various forms of our spelling. A word,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
when introduced into a language, is at first spelled
in accordance with the genius of the nation from
which it comes. By degrees, and generally by
slow degrees, it is moulded into a new form by
the genius and instinct of the language in which
it is at length naturalised; still, however, retaining
sufficient of its original form to indicate its source
and etymology. Various causes contribute to
effect this change; a difference in pronunciation;
the influence of some local dialect, political, religious,
or literary disputes, the example of popular
writers, &amp;c. &amp;c. may all assist in working a change
in the outward forms of words.</p>

<p>But a study of the subject will prove that this
operation must be the work of time, and that no
assumed power can, of itself, work a sudden change
in spelling. This alone is sufficient to account for
the failure of the phonographic system. It may
also be laid down for certain, that any newly-proposed
form of spelling which obscures or
destroys the derivation of a word stands but little
chance of success. The general body of writers
knew full well that if they had at once adopted
phonetic spelling, it would have inevitably involved
the language in confusion and ruin by the destruction
of its etymology, and would have thus effaced
every vestige of its beauty and variety.</p>

<span class="fs40">FLEXIBILITY, VARIETY, ETC. OF WORDS.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">The history of English shows that it has been
changed from a synthetical, to an analytical language,
that in the course of time it has lost nearly
all its inflections; and that for these endings have
been substituted signs and prepositions. Whether
this change has been for the better, or for the worse,
may be a matter for speculation; but allowing that,
in some respects, the language may have sustained
a loss by this process, it is not difficult to show
that for this we have some compensating advantages&mdash;and
that the change has been favourable
in at least two points: 1st. as regards variety of
sound in the endings of words: and 2. flexibility
in their use and application.</p>

<p>In Latin, the recurrence of the verb in the same
person naturally produced a repetition of the same
termination, which must have had a very disagreeable
and monotonous effect. In Cicero’s second
oration ‘in Catilinam,’ he has ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abi<em>it</em>, excess<em>it</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
erup<em>it</em>, evas<em>it</em>.</span>’ Four consecutive words ending in
<em>it</em>! Another example of monotonous repetition,
quoted by Cicero in his ‘De Naturâ Deorum’ is,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">clam<em>o</em>, postul<em>o</em>, obsecr<em>o</em>, or<em>o</em>, plor<em>o</em>, atque implor<em>o</em>
fidem.</span>’ Cæsar’s often-quoted letter, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ven<em>i</em>, vid<em>i</em>,
vic<em>i</em></span>’ is open to the same objection, as well as the
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tædet h<em>arum</em> quotidian<em>arum</em> form<em>arum</em></span>’ of Terence.
In all these cases, the repetition of the
endings must have produced a most harsh and
disagreeable effect; and if these passages were
translated into English, we should probably find
that every word had a different termination.</p>

<p>But the flexibility of our language, which arises
partly from the same cause, is another, and perhaps
more important consideration. We can easily understand
that the system of inflection, however
useful in itself, prevents the possibility of one part
of speech being used for another. In English,
‘love’ may be a noun or a verb; but in Latin or
French, we must use ‘amare’ or ‘aimer’ for the
verb, and ‘amor’ or ‘amour’ for the noun. This
power of using one part of speech for another,
exists to such an extent in English, that it may be
almost said, that every word in the language may
be applied in a variety of senses and grammatical
constructions. That this is of incalculable advantage,
every thoughtful English scholar will surely
allow; and it may be observed that not one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
modern languages of Europe possesses this elastic
power in the same degree as English. This may
be seen in the following cases:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. Almost all our verbs in common use may
be used as nouns. We have ‘to walk,’ or to take
‘a walk;’ ‘to ride,’ or to enjoy ‘a ride;’ ‘to
talk,’ or to have ‘a talk; ‘to offer,’ or to make ‘an
offer;’ ‘to visit,’ or, to pay ‘a visit,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. Nouns may be used as verbs:&mdash;We may say ‘a
telegraph;’ or ‘to telegraph’ a message; ‘butter,’
or ‘to butter’ bread; ‘sugar,’ or ‘to sugar’ tea;
‘a quarter,’ or ‘to quarter’ a regiment, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. Adjectives are used as nouns:&mdash;We may say
‘a round table,’ or, ‘a round’ of visits; a ‘green’
tree, or to play on ‘the green;’ a ‘beautiful’
prospect, or a love for ‘the beautiful.’ And not
only can we use the adjective as a noun; we may
even give it a plural form. We often speak of ‘eatables
and drinkables.’ A man may have a fit of
the ‘dismals,’ or the ‘blues;’ or he may be anxious
about his ‘good<em>s</em>,’ ‘moveable<em>s</em>,’ or ‘valuable<em>s</em>,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>4. Adjectives are frequently used as verbs:&mdash;as,
a ‘clear’ way, or to ‘clear’ the way; a ‘long’
distance, or to ‘long’ for something; a ‘still’
evening, or to ‘still’ the waves, &amp;c.</p>

<p>5. Comparative adjectives are occasionally used
as verbs; as ‘a better’ condition, or, ‘to better’
our condition; a ‘lower’ state, or to ‘lower’ a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
rope; ‘further’ remarks, or ‘to further’ a design;
‘utter’ nonsense, or ‘to utter’ opinions, &amp;c.</p>

<p>6. Personal pronouns may be used as nouns: as,
‘A downright <em>she</em>‘&mdash;(Byron.) ‘Left to be finished
by such a <em>she</em>.’&mdash;(Shakspere.)</p>

<p>7. Conjunctions are frequently used as nouns;
as, ‘But me no <em>buts</em>’ How many ‘<em>thats</em>’ are
there in the sentence? ‘Let us have no more <em>ifs</em>
and <em>ands</em>,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>8. Prepositions may be used in like manner: as,
The <em>ins</em> and <em>outs</em> of life. The ‘<em>ups</em> and <em>downs</em>’ of
fortune, &amp;c.</p>

<p>9. Even adverbs are sometimes constructed as
nouns; as:&mdash;Which are in the majority; the
‘<em>ayes</em>,’ or the ‘<em>noes</em>?’</p>

<p>This extraordinary plasticity of English applies
particularly to nouns signifying parts of the body.
There is scarcely one of these which may not be
turned into a verb. For example, we commonly
hear that a man ‘<em>faces</em>’ his difficulties with courage.
Hamlet says of Polonius, ‘You may <em>nose</em> him
in the lobby.’ In Shakspere’s ‘Tempest’ we
may read, ‘Full many a lady I have <em>eyed</em> with best
regard.’</p>

<p>To <em>jaw</em> is sometimes used, though not very
elegantly, in the sense of to chatter or scold. We
often hear of a man ‘<em>elbowing</em>’ his way through a
crowd, and Goldsmith’s ‘Deserted Village’ gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
us ‘<em>Shouldered</em> his arms, and showed how fields
were won.’</p>

<p>To ‘<em>hand</em>’ a plate, and to ‘<em>finger</em>’ a passage on
the piano, are everyday expressions. We also
frequently hear of a coachman ‘<em>backing</em>’ his
horses, and Shakspere has ‘to <em>foot</em> it featly.’
Besides these, may be noticed ‘to <em>thumb</em> the leaves
of a book’; to ‘<em>breast</em> the waves;’ ‘to <em>palm</em> off (for
to cheat or deceive);’ to <em>side</em> with a party; and
to <em>head</em> an expedition. To these may be added ‘to
<em>bone</em>’ a fowl; ‘to <em>skin</em>’ a rabbit, and many others.
It may be reasonably doubted whether this power
exists to anything like the same extent in the
continental languages.</p>

<p>But not only the names of parts of the body;
also those of many articles of domestic use are
employed in a similar way. We have to <em>chair</em> a
member; we hear that people are <em>boarded</em>, and
that the earth is <em>carpeted</em> with green. ‘<em>Curtained</em>’
sleep, and ‘<em>imbedded</em>’ in the earth, belong to the
same class. One man is said to <em>floor</em> another in
argument. To ‘<em>picture</em> to yourself;’ to <em>table</em> the
contents of a book; to be <em>closeted</em> with a friend,
to <em>book</em> a debt; to <em>pen</em> a letter; to <em>ink</em> a dress; to
<em>paper</em> a room, and to <em>shelve</em> a subject are all common
and daily expressions. They are, in every
sense of the term, <em>household</em> words.</p>

<p>In English, names of domestic animals are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Saxon; whereas wild beasts for the most part retain
their Latin or French names. Thus ‘cat,’ ‘hound,’
‘horse,’ ‘sheep,’ ‘cow,’ ‘swine,’ &amp;c., are of Germanic
origin; whilst ‘lion,’ ‘tiger,’ ‘elephant,’
‘leopard,’ ‘panther,’ &amp;c., come to us from Greek
through Latin. The power we have to use these
names of animals as verbs is another instance of the
elasticity of our language. This can be done with
some of the above Saxon names, though not with
those of wild beasts. The noun ‘horse’ is often
used as a verb: a stable-keeper is said to <em>horse</em> a
coach; i.e. to supply it with horses. We have also
<em>to dodge</em>; i.e. to follow a scent in and out like a dog.
A man is <em>hounded</em> on to do such and such work;
while to <em>rat</em> is to desert your party. Every one
knows that to <em>duck</em> is to dive in the water like a
duck. People are also said to be <em>gulled</em> when they
are easily deceived; and to <em>drone</em> when they read
or speak monotonously.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how often, colloquially, we
use the names of animals as types of temper or
character. True, this is not peculiar to the English
language: though the practice is perhaps here more
extended. People continually employ the word ‘ass’
or ‘donkey’ in the sense of a stupid loutish fellow.
They also often stigmatise a cunning man as a
‘fox;’ or a scolding shrew as a ‘vixen.’ A proud
little strut is called ‘a cock of the walk;’ and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'reckless spendrift'">reckless spendthrift</ins> is a ‘sad dog;’ or sometimes a
‘jolly dog.’ ‘Puppy’ is suggestive of conceit and
self-sufficiency; and a slothful, indolent man is
spoken of as a lazy ‘hound.’ A ‘hog’ is sometimes
used as a metaphor for a glutton; and a ‘pig’
for a dirty fellow. ‘Pig-headed’ is also applied
to one of stubborn temper; a ‘mule’ is a type of
obstinacy; and a ‘horse,’ in the sense of a beast
of burden, is found in ‘towel-horse,’ or ‘clothes-horse.’
Men of rude manners are spoken of as
‘bears,’ and the weak or timid in disposition are
called ‘chicken’-hearted. A fond mother speaks
of her child as her pet ‘lamb,’ or little ‘duck.’
Silliness is typified by ‘goose,’ and mischief by
‘monkey,’ &amp;c. Here it will be found that these
words are, with one or two exceptions, used in a
disparaging, and not in a favourable, sense. They
are, most of them, terms of reproach, not of
praise.</p>

<p>Words have not only degenerated in sense;
their outward form has also suffered. One principle&mdash;contraction&mdash;has
affected both the pronunciation
and spelling of many words. It may be
taken as a general rule that words, as they grow
older, become softer and shorter. They seldom
expand, but almost always contract. This probably
originated in a loose careless way of speaking,
which afterwards affected the written language.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Contractions appear in a great variety of forms.
1st. They are made by cutting off an initial syllable,
as ‘‘prentice,’ for ‘apprentice;’ ‘‘peach,’ for
‘impeach;’ ‘‘gin,’ for ‘engine;’ ‘‘suage,’ for ‘assuage;’
‘‘cyclopædia,’ for ‘encyclopædia;’ &amp;c.
Among the words which have lost their initial
letters, three are to be especially noticed: viz.
‘luck,’ ‘irksome,’ and ‘orchard.’ The first of
these was originally ‘Glück,’ and is still so spelled
in German, whence it comes. ‘Irksome’ was in
Anglo-Saxon written ‘(w)eorcsam,’ i.e. full of
work, and therefore troublesome; and ‘orchard’
is a corruption of ‘(w)ort-yard,’ that is, a yard in
which (worts) plants or vegetables were grown.
2nd. By cutting off a final syllable; as in ‘pro
and con,’ for ‘contra;’ ‘cit,’ for ‘citizen;’ ‘without,’
formerly ‘withouten;’ ‘incog,’ for ‘incognito;’
‘hyp,’ for ‘hypochondria;’ ‘consols,’ for
‘consolidated annuities,’ &amp;c. 3rd. By taking a
letter, or letters, from the middle of a word; as
‘else,’ for ‘elles;’ ‘lark,’ for ‘laverock;’ ‘last,’
for ‘latest;’ ‘lord,’ for ‘hlaford;’ ‘since,’ for
‘sithence;’ ‘parrot,’ for ‘perroquet;’ and ‘fortnight,’
for ‘fourteen nights;’ ‘cheer up’ is contracted
into ‘chirrup,’ and then into ‘chirp;’
‘speak’ comes from ‘sp<em>r</em>ecan;’ and the Anglo-Saxon
‘wi<em>f</em>man’ appears as ‘woman.’ By the
same law are formed many proper names. ‘Twell,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
for ‘at the well;’ ‘Thill,’ for ‘at the hill;’ ‘Oxford,’
for ‘Ox<em>en</em>ford;’ ‘Cambridge,’ for ‘Cant<em>e</em>brigge,’
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Many other cases may be cited as examples of
this law. The word ‘(E)piscop(us)’ has suffered
a mutilation at both the beginning and the end;
and appears in English as ‘Bishop.’ The prefix
‘ge,’ commonly used in Saxon, and still retained
in German participles, lingered for some time in
English in the softened form of <em>y</em>; as in ‘<em>y</em>clept,’
‘<em>y</em>clothed,’ &amp;c.; but it has now vanished from the
language. Another instance of the same tendency
may be seen in the present pronunciation of participles
ending in ‘ed.’ Formerly, the word ‘used’
was always pronounced as a dissyllable&mdash;‘usèd;’
now it is universally pronounced as a monosyllable.
Indeed, this final ‘ed,’ as a distinct syllable
though still occasionally heard in the pulpit, is
fast disappearing from our language.</p>

<p>Contraction was the main principle on which
the ancient Latin was transformed into French.
It is curious to observe that though this contracting
power did operate in Italian, it was not there
carried out to the same degree as in French; that
is, though Italian words are, in most cases,
shorter than their Latin equivalents, they are not
so contracted as the French words of the same
meaning. This may be easily shown by comparison:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">and many others.</p>


<h3><em>Expansion.</em></h3>

<p>On the other hand, there are some few cases
where words are expanded or widened by the insertion
of a letter. 1st. Of a vowel. We have
‘alar<em>u</em>m,’ for ‘alarm;’ ‘law<em>y</em>er,’ for ‘lawer;’
‘cloth<em>i</em>er,’ for ‘clother.’ The <em>i</em> is also inserted in
‘parl<em>i</em>ament,’ ‘Sav<em>i</em>our,’ ‘hand<em>i</em>craft,’ ‘hand<em>i</em>work,’
‘per<em>i</em>winkle,’ and a few others.</p>

<p>2nd. Sometimes, <em>l</em> or <em>r</em> is inserted; as in ‘princip<em>l</em>e,’
from ‘principe;’ ‘syllab<em>l</em>e,’ from ‘syllabe;’
‘cart<em>r</em>idge,’ from ‘cartouche;’ ‘part<em>r</em>idge,’ from
the Latin ‘perdix,’ through the French ‘perd<em>r</em>ix;’
‘g<em>r</em>oom,’ from the Anglo-Saxon ‘guma,’ a man;
‘vag<em>r</em>ant,’ from ‘vagans;’ and ‘co<em>r</em>poral,’ from
‘caporal.’</p>

<p>3rd. P and B are often inserted after <em>m</em>; as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
’em<em>p</em>ty,’ Anglo-Saxon ‘æmtig,’ ‘tem<em>p</em>t,’ from
the French ‘tenter;’ ’em<em>b</em>ers,’ from the Anglo-Saxon
‘æmyrje;’ ‘nim<em>b</em>le,’ from the Anglo-Saxon
‘nemol.’ Also in ‘lam<em>b</em>,’ ‘lim<em>b</em>,’ ‘crum<em>b</em>,’ ‘thum<em>b</em>,’
and ‘num<em>b</em>,’ the <em>b</em> forms no part of the root.</p>

<p>4th. D naturally attaches itself to <em>n</em> final; as in
‘soun<em>d</em>,’ ‘riban<em>d</em>,’ ‘len<em>d</em>,’ &amp;c. This may probably
account for certain provincial pronunciations, as
‘gown<em>d</em>,’ ‘drown<em>d</em>,’ &amp;c. Also in ‘thun<em>d</em>er,’ ‘kin<em>d</em>red,’
and ‘yon<em>d</em>er,’ the <em>d</em> is parasitical.</p>


<h3><em>Assimilation.</em></h3>

<p>Assimilation, or the coming together of letters
which have an affinity for each other, is a principle
which affects the spelling, as well as the
pronunciation, of many English words. This law
softens the pronunciation, and will account for the
frequent occurrence of a double consonant at the
beginning of a large class of words. The rule is
here:&mdash;‘<em>When a prefix ending in a consonant is
applied to a root beginning with one, that consonant
disappears, and there is substituted for it the initial
consonant of the root</em>.’ This happens most frequently
in English words compounded with Latin
prepositions. The <em>d</em> in the preposition ‘<em>ad</em>’ is
often assimilated to the initial consonant of the
root to which it is applied.</p>

<p>The word ‘a<em>cc</em>ede’ is made up of ‘ad’ (to) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
‘cede’ (come). But the initial <em>c</em> in ‘cede’ assimilated
to itself the <em>d</em> in ‘ad,’ i.e. changed it
into a <em>c</em>. Thus ‘adcede’ became ‘a<em>cc</em>ede.’ This
law will account for the double consonant in such
forms as ‘a<em>cc</em>ost,’ ‘a<em>gg</em>rieve,’ ‘a<em>ll</em>ude,’ ‘a<em>mm</em>unition,’
‘a<em>nn</em>ex,’ ‘a<em>pp</em>ly,’ ‘a<em>ss</em>ist,’ ‘a<em>tt</em>ract,’ and many
others. In all these cases the first syllable was
originally ‘<em>ad</em>.’</p>

<p>This law applies with equal force to other Latin
prepositions which enter into the formation of
English words; as ‘con,’ ‘in,’ ‘per,’ ‘sub,’ &amp;c.
We spell the word ‘co<em>ll</em>ect’ for ‘conlect;’ ‘co<em>mm</em>une,’
for ‘conmune,’ &amp;c. On the same principle
we write ‘i<em>ll</em>egal,’ for ‘inlegal;’ ‘i<em>rr</em>egular,’ for
‘inregular;’ ‘pe<em>ll</em>ucid,’ for ‘perlucid;’ ‘su<em>cc</em>umb,’
for ‘subcumb;’ and many others. But when the
root begins with a labial (<em>b</em>, <em>p</em>, or <em>m</em>), then the
final consonant of the preposition is always
changed into <em>m</em>. This is why we write ‘i<em>m</em>bibe,’
and not ‘ibbibe;’ ‘i<em>m</em>bue,’ not ‘ibbue;’ and ‘i<em>m</em>possible,’
not ‘ipposible,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>This principle of assimilation has operated in
the formation of the words ‘ha<em>mm</em>ock’ and ‘sti<em>rr</em>up.’
The first is from ‘hang-mat,’ where the <em>ng</em>
has been assimilated to <em>m</em>. The second is from
the Anglo-Saxon ‘stig-rope’ (literally, ‘mount-rope,’
or rope to mount by), where <em>r</em> is substituted
for the <em>g</em> in ‘stig.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>


<h3><em>Attraction.</em></h3>

<p>Attraction is another principle which affects the
forms of certain words. Sometimes a consonant
is drawn away from the word to which it properly
belongs, and becomes a part of its neighbour. The
effect of this law is especially remarkable in the
article ‘<em>an</em>.’ In certain cases the <em>n</em> (of a<em>n</em>) does
not really belong to the article, but is the initial
letter of the noun following. This happens in the
case of ‘an orange;’ the word ‘orange’ is, in
Spanish, whence it is derived, ‘naranja,’ and we
should therefore write ‘a norange’ rather than
‘an orange.’ But the article <em>a</em> has attracted to
itself the initial <em>n</em> of the noun, and the result is&mdash;‘an
orange.’ For the same reason ‘an adder’
should be written ‘a natter,’ or ‘a nadder.’ On
the other hand, there are cases in which the <em>n</em> of
the article is attracted into the following word.
If the word ‘apron’ is from the French ‘naperon’
(from nappe, cloth), we should write ‘a napron,’
and not ‘an apron.’ Several of these cases may be
pointed out. We say and write, ‘a neap tide,’
instead of ‘an ebb tide;’ ‘a newt,’ for ‘an ewt’
(or eft); and, on the other hand, ‘an auger,’ for
‘a nauger;’ ‘an awl,’ for ‘a nawl;’ and ‘an umpire’
for ‘a nompire.’ The same principle operates
in certain French expressions. The province of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Southern Italy formerly known as ‘Apulia,’ is
in French written ‘La Pouille.’ Here the <em>a</em> initial
of ‘Apulia’ is attracted into the article. The
expression should be ‘L’Apouille,’ and not ‘La
Pouille.’ In the same way, the French call ‘Anatolia’
(Asia Minor), ‘La Natolie;’ whereas it
should be written ‘L’Anatolie.’ It is from the
Greek ἀνατολή&mdash;the rising of the sun.</p>


<h3><em>Accent.</em></h3>

<p>The accent of an English word depends chiefly
on its derivation. In words of Saxon origin, it
is placed on the root. For example, ‘lóve’ is an
accented monosyllable, and preserves its accent on
the root, in all its derivations; as in ‘lóving,’
‘lóveliness,’ ‘lóveable,’ &amp;c. But in Romance
words, the tendency is to put the accent on the
branches, and not on the root. In French, the
vocabulary is drawn mainly from Latin words
without their inflections. The French words
‘natúre,’ ‘fatál,’ ‘aimáble,’ &amp;c., have the accent
on the second syllable, because they are formed
from the Latin ‘natúra,’ ‘fatális,’ and ‘amábilis,’
without the endings. But in English all these and
similar words are accented on the first syllable;
and we pronounce them ‘náture,’ ‘fátal,’ ‘ámiable.’
In Chaucer’s poetry, many French words are
accented on the second or third syllable, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
accordance with the classical principle; thus, we
there find ‘honóur,’ ‘natión,’ ‘companý,’ &amp;c. All
these, after Chaucer’s time, shifted the accent back
to the first syllable, thus conforming themselves
to the genius of the English language. There is,
to this day, in English a conflict in the accent
between the two principles, the Teutonic and the
Romance; the former leaning to the root, and the
latter to the branches of the word. But even in
classical words, as regards accent, the Saxon
genius clearly prevails. We accent the word
‘órdinary’ on the first syllable, which contains
the pith of its meaning; whereas the French place
the accent on the last&mdash;‘ordináire.’ It was probably
the antagonism between these two principles&mdash;the
Germanic tendency toward the beginning,
and the Romance toward the end, of the word,
which caused the accent in English to be so long
unsettled. But the genius of the Saxon eventually
triumphed over the French element, in
accent as well as in grammatical forms, and the
general rule in English pronunciation, is to put
the accent on the root.</p>

<p>The spelling of certain English derivatives depends
on the place of the accent in their roots.
Now, when the last syllable of the root is accented,
the final consonant must be doubled in the derivative.
This accounts for the root ‘rób’ (with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
b), making ‘ro<em>bb</em>ed,’ and ‘ro<em>bb</em>er,’ (with two b’s)
admí<em>t</em> (one <em>t</em>), making admi<em>tt</em>ed (two t’s), &amp;c.</p>

<p>But when the accent lies on any other syllable
of the root, the final consonant must remain single
in the derivative, as ‘límit,’ ‘lími<em>t</em>ed;’ ‘díffer,’ ‘díffe<em>r</em>ing;’
‘bénefit,’ ‘bénefi<em>t</em>ed;’ &amp;c. This rule applies
only to root-endings consisting of a single vowel followed
by a single consonant; for if a diphthong
precede, the consonant must remain single in the
derivative. We must therefore write ‘joi<em>n</em>er,’ ‘stea<em>m</em>ing,’
‘toi<em>l</em>ing,’ ‘rea<em>d</em>er,’ &amp;c., with single consonants.</p>

<p>But there are exceptions to this general rule.
One especially regards roots ending in <em>l</em>. These
always double the <em>l</em> in the derivative, whether the
last syllable of the root be accented or not. The
verb ‘to expél,’ will, by the above rule, naturally
make its past tense, ‘expelled;’ but why should
‘trável’ give ‘traveller,’ or ‘équal,’ ‘equalled?’
These, though universally adopted, are clearly
against the principle. Two other words are also
exceptions, ‘worship,’ and ‘bias.’ These make
‘worshipped,’ and ‘biassed,’ with double consonants.
The Americans refuse to admit these exceptions,
and they write ‘trave<em>l</em>er,’ ‘equa<em>l</em>ed,’ ‘worshi<em>p</em>ed,’
and ‘bia<em>s</em>ed,’ with single consonants. It
must be admitted that they are right in principle,
but the general practice in English is in these cases
decidedly in favour of the double consonant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>


<h3><em>Inversion.</em></h3>

<p>There appears in certain letters a peculiar tendency
to get out of order&mdash;to slip into a wrong
place&mdash;a restless desire for change. No letter of
the alphabet is more subject to this affection than
the liquid, <em>r</em>. Many French words ending in <em>re</em>,
are found in English to end in <em>er</em>. The French
‘lett<em>re</em>’ is in English ‘lett<em>er</em>.’ The final syllables
of ‘Septembre,’ ‘Octobre,’ ‘Novembre’ and ‘Décembre,’
are inverted in English, and are written
‘Septemb<em>er</em>,’ &amp;c. The Greek root ἑρπ (creep)
gave in Latin ‘<em>rep</em>ĕre;’ whence we have ‘<em>rep</em>tile,’
&amp;c. ‘B<em>ru</em>nt,’ is derived from ‘b<em>ur</em>n.’ The ‘brunt’
of a battle is where it ‘burns’ most fiercely.
Again: a ‘p<em>ur</em>pose’ is what we ‘p<em>ro</em>pose’ to do;
and ‘to t<em>ru</em>ndle’ a hoop is to ‘t<em>ur</em>n’ it repeatedly.
The Saxon verb ‘<em>ur</em>nan,’ is the source of the
English ‘<em>ru</em>n.’ ‘B<em>ri</em>mstone’ is an inversion of
‘b<em>ur</em>n-stone;’ and the verb to ‘ask,’ was in Anglo-Saxon,
‘axian.’ Chaucer has ‘drit’ for ‘dirt;’
‘briddes,’ for ‘birds,’ &amp;c.</p>


<h3><em>Corruption.</em></h3>

<p>When a word is warped or distorted from its
original form, either by a vicious pronunciation,
or by a mistaken notion of its derivation, it is
said to be a corruption. Though we must accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and adopt the usual spelling of such words, it may
be useful and interesting to know what brought
them into their present forms.</p>

<p>When a word is first pronounced in the hearing
of those who do not know its meaning, its
spelling naturally becomes with them, a mere
imitation of the sound. It is remarkable how
often these corruptions appear in the names of
taverns and ships. Such words being most frequently
in the mouths of the illiterate, will soon
acquire a false pronunciation, which, after a time,
leads to a false spelling, and hence many of their
present forms. It was this rude attempt to
imitate a sound that led the sailors to call their
ship ‘Bellerophon’ the ‘Billy Ruffian.’ From the
same cause, the sign of the ‘Boulogne Mouth’ was
corrupted into ‘Bull and Mouth;’ and the ‘Bacchanals’
(a very appropriate name for an inn),
was transformed into the ‘Bag of Nails.’ It is
said that our soldiers in India could never be
taught to pronounce properly ‘Surajah Dowlah,’
the name of that Bengal prince who figured in
the affair of the Black Hole. They persisted in
calling him ‘Sir Roger Dowlas!’</p>

<p>Some of these corrupt forms are so firmly rooted
in the language, that they must now be recognised
as correct, and adopted accordingly. We are told
that the word ‘grocer’ was originally ‘grosser,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and meant one who sold articles in the gross (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
gros</i>). This is probably the true explanation; but
we must not, on that account, revert to the old
spelling. It would be eccentric and pedantic in
the extreme to write ‘rightwise’ for ‘righteous;’
‘frontispice’ for ‘frontispiece,’ or ‘shamefast’
for ‘shamefaced;’ for though the first may have
been the true and original form of these words,
custom must here take precedence of derivation,
and we must spell them according to the present
usual practice.</p>

<span class="fs40">DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE SAME IDEA.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">It is worthy of observation that all nations do not
express the same idea by the same form of word,
i.e. that in different languages the same idea is
often represented by a word of a distinctly different
root. How comes it, we may ask, that the
Romance languages of Europe, viz. French,
Italian, Spanish, &amp;c. all use forms of the originally
same word to express their idea of ‘<em>king</em>,’ viz.
roi, re, rey? These languages being off-shoots of
Latin, the above words are all derived from the
Latin ‘rex,’ from ‘rego,’ ‘I rule,’ or exert physical
power. Now in the Teutonic languages of Europe&mdash;Dutch,
German, English, etc.&mdash;we find this
idea in a very different phase: ‘Konig,’ ‘König,’
‘King.’ The root of these words may be found in
‘kennen,’ ‘to know.’ From this it would appear
that the idea of a ruler in one class of nations was
a physically strong man, who, by means of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
bodily strength, could force his subjects to do his
will. The Saxon for ‘king’ was ‘cyning,’ from
‘cnawan’ to know, i.e. one who ‘knew’ better
than his subjects or followers&mdash;who was superior
to them in knowledge. We may, perhaps, conclude
from this that the Romance nations regarded
strength or physical power as the distinguishing
quality of a ruler; whereas the Germanic tribes
saw in their leader one who was able to guide
them aright by his superior thought and judgment.
The Romans looked to the hand, the Germans
to the head, in this matter. Is it not likely
that attention to such differences may throw some
light on national characteristics?</p>

<p>Another example of this difference of view of
the same idea may be seen in the English word
‘finger,’ as compared with the French ‘doigt.’
‘Finger’ is connected with the German ‘fangen,’
to take hold of, and is a relation of our word
‘fang,’ i.e. the tooth with which certain animals
<em>hold</em> their prey. In the Germanic view of the
word it is the instrument with which we ‘take
hold.’ On the other hand, the Greek δάκτυλος, from δείκνυμι,
I show or point out, appeared in Latin
as ‘digitus;’ passed into Italian as ‘dito,’ and into
French as ‘doigt.’ The Romance view of the word
would then be ‘a pointer or indicator,’ and the
Teutonic a holder or catcher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The French word ‘mouchoir’ will also illustrate
this difference of view. This is from ‘(se) moucher,’
to wipe (the nose). It would be considered extremely
vulgar to call this article in English ‘a
wiper,’ and yet this is literally its French meaning.
The Germans have named it ‘Schnupftuch,’ or
‘snuff-cloth,’ another view of the same thing. But
the corresponding English word, ‘handkerchief,’
presents us with a most curious anomaly. The first
form of the word was ‘kerchief,’ which is the old
French ‘couvre-chef,’ i.e. a covering for the head,
just as ‘curfew’ was from ‘couvre-feu’&mdash;‘cover-fire.’
Milton has the word ‘kerchiefed’ in the
sense of ‘with the head covered.’ He speaks of
Morn&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse"><em>Kerchiefed</em> in a comely cloud.&mdash;<em>Penseroso.</em></p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Now, if to ‘kerchief’ we prefix ‘hand,’ we have a
word which seems to mean a covering for the head,
held in the hand&mdash;which is a manifest absurdity!
But the climax of confusion is reached when we
qualify this word by ‘pocket.’ How the covering
for the <em>head</em> is to be held in the <em>hand</em>, and yet
carried in the <em>pocket</em> is enough to puzzle anyone.</p>

<p>Another instance of this description may be
seen in the word ‘heaven.’ In the Teutonic
languages it represents the idea of something
raised on high, or <em>heaved</em> up&mdash;from ‘heafan’ and
‘heben,’ to lift up, or elevate. But the Romance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
view of this word is connected with the idea of
hollowness or concavity. The Greek κοῖλον; the
Latin ‘cœlum;’ the Italian ‘cielo;’ and the French
‘ciel’&mdash;all involve the meaning of a hollow, or
arched covering.</p>

<p>A great variety of expression may be also
seen if we compare together the idioms of several
European languages. These peculiarities may be
looked upon as characterising the tone and habits
of thought of a nation, and they deserve especial
study and attention. If we take the usual form
of greeting in English&mdash;‘How do you do?’ here
we may see that the verb <em>do</em> is indicative of the
activity and practical nature of the English mind.
It would seem as if in this country our bodily
health actually depends upon our <em>doing</em>; i.e. our
business habits; that to be occupied is equivalent
to being in good health. Now if we take the
ordinary corresponding French phrase&mdash;‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comment
vous <em>portez</em>-vous?</span>’&mdash;we may fairly infer that the
well-being in this case depends on the <em>carriage</em>,
or outward bearing of the person. The Germans,
under the same circumstances, say: ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wie befinden
Sie sich?</span>’ (literally, ‘how do they <em>find</em> themselves?’)
May not this form of expression throw
some light on the German character? May it
not point to that tendency to deep reflection which
is known to be so strikingly distinctive of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
German tone of mind? From this we may conclude
that the German is so habituated to deep
thought that he cannot even tell you the state of
his health, without searching till he <em>finds</em> it out.
The Italian corresponding form, ‘<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Come sta?</span>’ (literally,
‘How does he stand?’), is referred to the <em>standing</em>
of the Lombard merchants in the market-place;
and in this case, the well-being or health seems to
have depended on the prosperity of the dealer.
In these remarks on the different forms of greeting,
there may appear something fanciful, but one
thing is clear, viz. that they all differ from each
other, and it is but natural to conclude, that each
has some connection with the turn of mind of the
people to which it belongs. Of course it would
be wrong to form positive opinions concerning
national character, from the examination of only
one idiom; and it would be necessary to collect
and compare a large number of examples to arrive
at satisfactory conclusions on this head. But we
should look into the philosophy of idiom more
keenly, for here we are most likely to find a key
to the character of every civilised nation.</p>

<p>Another example of this variety may be seen
in the form of address adopted in the different
countries of Europe. We English speak to one
another in the second person plural, even when
we address one person. We say ‘you are,’ to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
single person, and if we have to address a thousand,
we must use the same form. This may,
probably, partly account for the grammatical fault
so commonly made by the uneducated&mdash;‘<em>you was</em>.’
Feeling that they are speaking to only one person,
and not knowing that the pronoun (you) is, strictly
speaking, plural, they very naturally&mdash;though, of
course, incorrectly&mdash;put the ‘you’ and the ‘was’
together.</p>

<p>The French also adopt the second person plural
in the same case&mdash;‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vous êtes.</span>’ But they use the
second person singular much more frequently than
we do, especially between relations and intimate
friends. ‘Tu’ and ‘toi,’ however, have lost much
of their former charm since the great revolution,
when the levelling spirit of the Government merged
all differences of rank into one common form of
address. In certain circumstances, the French
use the third person singular as a mark of respect.
When a lady goes into a shop in Paris, the first
question asked her is, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qu’est-ce que madame
désire?</span>’ and, in the same way, her servant says to
her, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame, a-t-elle sonné?</span>’</p>

<p>The Germans, in the same circumstances, use
the third person plural&mdash;‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sie sind,</span>’ literally ‘they
are.’ This usage has prevailed in Germany ever
since the sixteenth century, and is supposed to
express respect. But in cases of intimacy, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
relationship, the Germans also use the pronoun of
the second person singular. A German husband
always addresses his wife, or a brother his sister,
as <em>du</em>, but if scorn or contempt be intended, then
the third person singular is adopted. In Germany,
the best way to get rid of an importunate beggar
is to exclaim, ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Was will <em>er</em>?</span>’ which is about equivalent
to our ‘What does the fellow want?’</p>

<p>Majesty still speaks, in this country, in the
plural number. The Queen issues a proclamation,
beginning with:&mdash;‘Given at <em>our</em> court of St.
James’, &amp;c. The editorial ‘we’ is also well known
as expressing a certain importance and authority.
In Italy, the form used in addressing any one is
the third person singular, ‘<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Come sta,</span>’ literally,
‘How does he stand?’</p>

<p>If we compare the words which express degrees
of kindred or relationship in one language with
those of a corresponding class in another, we shall
find distinctly different pictures. The French words
‘mari’ and ‘femme,’ merely show a difference of sex.
‘Mari’ is from the Latin ‘maritus’ (mas, maris), ‘a
male,’ and ‘femme,’ is derived from ‘femina,’ ‘female.’
But if we put against these the corresponding
English terms ‘husband’ and ‘wife,’ a totally
new scene is opened to our view. ‘Husband’ is
etymologically, the ‘man of the house,’ or the ‘house-protector;’
and the ‘wife’ is the ‘weaving-one.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Indeed, we shall find that most of the Saxon words
expressing degrees of kindred, have reference to
occupations. The <em>hus</em>band was the head or protector
of the house. The wife (as her name
shows) <em>wove</em> the cloth for the use of the family.
But before the cloth could be woven, it must be
<em>spun</em>, and this was done by the grown-up unmarried
women, for that reason called ‘<em>spinsters</em>.’
The word ‘daughter’ is traced to a Sanscrit root,
‘dhu’&mdash;milk; whence we infer that the daughters
milked the cows, a very appropriate occupation in
a primitive state of society. The word ‘son’ is
supposed to be derived from a Sanscrit root ‘<em>su</em>’
or ‘<em>pu</em>,’ originally signifying ‘clean,’ from which
we may conclude that their office was to <em>clean</em> out
the house. The ‘husband’ then was the ‘protector;’
the ‘wife,’ the ‘weaver;’ the ‘unmarried
women,’ the ‘spinners’ (or ‘spinsters’); the
‘daughters,’ the ‘milkers;’ and the ‘sons,’ the
‘cleaners.’ With what hallowed feelings are all
these words associated, and what a vivid picture
do they present of the primitive simplicity of
family society! No such picture of domestic life
is exhibited in the Latin or French words which
express these relations, and we may look in vain
for anything of this sort in the Romance languages.</p>

<p>The Teutonic view of the place of punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in a future life, somewhat differs from the Romance.
We English call it <em>hell</em>, the French and Italians,
<em>enfer</em> and <em>inferno</em>. Our word is derived from the
old Saxon verb ‘<em>helan</em>,’ ‘to cover up’ or ‘hide;’
‘enfer’ and ‘inferno’ are from ‘inferus,’ ‘below,’
so that the Germanic idea is here ‘a concealed or
covered place;’ the classical view of the same is
‘the place below, or underground.’</p>

<p>If we compare the English word ‘<em>shoe</em>,’ with
the French ‘<em>soulier</em>’ we shall also find a difference
in the original meaning. They both represent the
same article of dress, but our word ‘<em>shoe</em>’ is from
‘shove,’ it is that into which we ‘shove’ the foot;
whereas the French ‘<em>soulier</em>’ rather suggests ‘sandal’
than ‘shoe,’ properly so called. It means
literally, something ‘bound under’ (sous-lié), i.e.
under the foot.</p>

<p>Our common word ‘<em>thimble</em>,’ is connected with
‘thumb,’ on which it was originally worn. The
Germans choose to call this article ‘<em>Fingerhut</em>,’
literally, a ‘finger-hat,’ i.e. a hat or covering for
the finger.</p>

<span class="fs40">COMPOUND WORDS.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">One of the greatest advantages a language can
possess, is the power of forming compound words.
This materially contributes to its conciseness;&mdash;makes
it comparatively easy to express much in
few words&mdash;and thus assists, by concentrating its
force, in rendering it vigorous and impressive.
This power of compounding is found chiefly in the
Teutonic languages of Europe; and is comparatively
unknown in the Romance. In our own
case, it was considerably modified by the Norman
Conquest, which introduced a French (or Latin)
element into English. We still, however, possess
this power to a considerable extent; and herein
we enjoy certain advantages unknown to French
or Italian. German, the most cultivated of all
the Teutonic languages, has much more of this
characteristic; and, in point of closeness and compactness
of expression, is superior to English. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
there are symptoms of its still further decrease in
our language, and it is worthy of observation that
the general tendency with us is to give up Saxon
compounds, and to substitute for them Latin or
French terms. The old word ‘deathsman’ has its
present equivalent in ‘executioner;’ ‘mildheartedness’
has become ‘mercy;’ ‘long-suffering,’ ‘patience,’
&amp;c. The verb ‘to gainsay’ still lingers in
the language, but its place is now generally taken
by ‘to contradict.’ ‘To gainstrive’ is supplanted
by ‘to oppose.’ ‘To inspect’ is preferred before
‘to look into;’ and ‘to despise’ is used rather than
‘to look down upon.’</p>

<p>The first English poet who gave prominence to
this power of combination was Chapman, who
applied it with wonderfully happy effect in his
Homer’s Iliad, in translating the compound Greek
epithets which so frequently occur in that poem;
such as ‘swift-footed;’ ‘ivory-wristed;’ ‘white-armed;’
‘many-headed;’ ‘rosy-fingered,’ &amp;c.
Most of these were afterwards adopted by Pope.
There is a tendency in some modern English
writers to carry this compounding power to an
unwarrantable extent, a practice which should
certainly be resisted, as being opposed to the
genius of our language, and also giving evidence
of aping after Germanic forms, and thus transgressing
the proper limits of the language. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
late Madame d’Arblay, in her ‘Memoirs of Dr.
Burney,’ speaks of the ‘very-handsome,-though-no-longer-in-her-bloom-Mrs.
Stevens!’ and this
authoress also has the ‘sudden-at-the-moment-though-from-lingering-illness-often-previously-expected-death.’
But this is really too bad. ‘It
out-Herods Herod;’ and in these cases is a mere
piece of affectation.</p>

<p>The mania at one time for these long-tailed adjectives,
was very cleverly ridiculed by the brothers
James and Horace Smith, in their ‘Rejected
Addresses.’ Here in caricaturing the style of the
‘Morning Post,’ they speak of the ‘not-a-bit-the-less-on-that-account-to-be-universally-execrated-monster-Bonaparte.’
Another of these extraordinary
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'epithetsis'">epithets is</ins>:&mdash;‘That-deeply-to-be-abhorred-and-highly-to-be-blamed-stratagem-the-Gunpowder-Plot!’
But the climax of the caricature is reached
in the following. Speaking of Covent-garden market,
the writer calls it ‘The-in-general-strewn-with-cabbage-stalks-but-on-Saturday-night-lighted-up-with-lamps-market-of-Covent-garden!!’
But such legitimate compound forms as ‘ill-assorted,’
‘cloud-capped,’ ‘far-darting,’ &amp;c., are highly valuable,
and of great service to the language. It is
to be observed that none of these are literally
translatable into French. For such an adjective
as ‘broken-hearted,’ there is no corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
equivalent in that language. The only way to
express, in French, any approach to the meaning
of our word, is to use a ponderous circumlocution,
which will require at least three or four terms.
The expression is thus enfeebled by being broken
up into a number of words, and it loses all the
force and vigour of the English. A ‘broken-hearted
father’ would be probably expressed in
French by ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un père qui a le cœur brisé</span>’&mdash;exactly
five words for our one. And so of all other compound
terms. In fact, French does not lend itself
to closeness and compactness of expression; and,
in this respect, is far inferior to any of the Teutonic
languages.</p>

<p>One peculiarity of the Saxon part of English is
its monosyllabic nature. This was chiefly caused
by the falling-off of the endings. All our prepositions
and conjunctions, beside most of the nouns,
verbs, and adjectives in common use, are monosyllables.
These form the staple of the English
language, and are the chief elements of closeness
and brevity of expression. Our legitimate compound
words seldom consist of more than two, or
at most three, elements. The greater number are
made up of monosyllables; as ‘milk-maid,’ ‘oat-meal,’
‘foot-boy,’ ‘hail-storm,’ &amp;c. In a few
cases, they are compounded of three terms, as
‘out-of-doors,’ ‘matter-of-fact,’ ‘out-of-the-way,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
&amp;c.; but these are comparatively rare. There are
few, if perhaps any, cases of English words which
have more than seven syllables. This seems to
be the length of our tether in this respect.
Perhaps it is as well that it should be so; for
whatever may be said of the use of the compounding
principle, as giving closeness and energy of
expression, there is no doubt that, when carried
to excess, it has a directly contrary effect. When
a very large number of elements are fused together
into one word, there is naturally a difficulty in
getting at the original root and primary meaning
of the whole; and the expression becomes cumbrous
and unintelligible.</p>

<p>This combining or compounding power is of
different degrees in different languages, but in the
Mexican language it is carried to an incredible
extent. Here, combinations are admitted so easily,
that the simplest ideas are buried under a load of
accessories. For example, the word for a ‘priest,’
consists of eleven syllables, and is there called
‘notlazomahuizleopixcatatzin,’ which means literally,
‘venerable minister of God, whom I love as
my father.’ A still more comprehensive word is
‘amatlacuilolitquitcatlaxtlahuitli,’ which means
‘the reward given to a messenger who brings a
hieroglyphical map conveying intelligence.’</p>

<p>This system displays a most curious mechanism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
which, by bringing the greatest number of ideas
into the smallest possible compass, condenses
whole sentences into a single word. Many of our
older writers indulged in derivatives and compound
words to an extent which the language does not
now admit, in consequence of its having lost part
of its Saxon character. We still have ‘to undo;’
but to ‘unput’ (for to take away) and to ‘undestroy’
(for to rebuild) were formerly used, and
Fuller even employs the verb ‘<em>to ungrayhair</em>,’ in
the sense of ‘to pull out gray hairs.’ He writes
of a man being ‘ungrayhaired,’ when all his gray
hairs were plucked out of his head!</p>

<span class="fs40">THE PRONUNCIATION OF WORDS.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">It is simply impossible to express sound by writing,
and therefore all instruction in pronunciation
should be given vivâ voce. A pronouncing Dictionary
may sometimes afford assistance; but
in many cases it must fail, as it is an attempt to
explain varieties or shades of sound by varieties of
shape, i.e. combinations of written letters&mdash;in fine,
objects of one sense by those of another.</p>

<p>It is not easy to fix a standard of pronunciation.
At one time the stage, then the bar, and, later
still, the pulpit, have been considered as authorities
in this matter. But all these are now rejected,
and the conversation of the highest classes in
London society is now looked upon as the standard
of English pronunciation.</p>

<p>Pronunciation, like everything else connected
with language, varies continually with the influence
of time and fashion; and it is well known that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
even fifty years ago, many English words were pronounced
differently from the present practice. It
was formerly the fashion to pronounce ‘leisure’
(which now rhymes with ‘pleasure’) as if written
‘leezure’ (to rhyme with ‘seizure’). This was
never a vulgar pronunciation; it was done by
the highest classes. It was also the fashion to
pronounce ‘oblige’ more like the French verb
‘obliger’ as if written ‘obl<em>ee</em>ge,’ and this also
was the practice with the best educated. ‘Gold’
also was formerly pronounced by good speakers
as if rhyming with ‘ruled;’ now it properly
rhymes with ‘old’ or ‘cold.’</p>

<p>We may conclude, from some of Pope’s rhymes,
that, in the early part of the eighteenth century,
our language was not pronounced exactly as it is
at present. He has ‘line’ and ‘join’ rhyming
with each other; also ‘vice’ and ‘destroys,’
‘power’ and ‘secure,’ ‘safe’ and ‘laugh,’ ‘obey’
and ‘tea,’ &amp;c. Some of these may have been
peculiar to the poet himself, and may be regarded
as bad rhymes; still, as Pope was an authority for
the language of his own time, most of them were,
in all probability, recognised as correct.</p>

<p>Stories are told of the peculiar pronunciation of
some of the leading literati of the last century
which appear scarcely credible. Dr. Johnson is
said to have pronounced the word ‘fair’ like ‘fear,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and the adverb ‘once’ as if written ‘woonse.’
He also called ‘punch’ ‘poonsh.’ Garrick was
often remarked for saying ‘shupreme’ and ‘shuperior’
for ‘supreme’ and ‘superior.’ He also pronounced
‘Israel’ as ‘Isrel,’ ‘villain’ as if ‘villin,’
and, still more strangely, ‘appeal’ as ‘appal.’</p>

<p>John Kemble had several peculiarities of pronunciation.
He is known to have always said
‘bird’ for ‘beard,’ ‘ferse’ for ‘fierce,’ and my
head ‘aitches’ (for ‘aches’). He persisted, too,
in pronouncing ‘Cato’ with the <em>a</em> broad, as if
written ‘Cāāto.’ Of this peculiarity an amusing
anecdote is related. ‘One evening, at the Dublin
Theatre, after the performance of Addison’s tragedy,
the manager appeared on the stage, and
made the following statement:&mdash;“Ladies and
gentlemen, to-morrow evening, with your permission,
the tragedy of Cato will be repeated, the
part of ‘<em>Cāāto</em>’ by Mr. Kemble.”’</p>

<p>Another story is told of the same eminent actor,
who, when George III. said to him: ‘Mr. Kemble,
will you “obleege” me with a pinch of your
snuff?’ replied: ‘With pleasure, your Majesty;
but it would become your royal lips much better
to say “oblīge.”’</p>

<p>Some of the actor Quin’s pronunciations would
be now considered very singular. He always pronounced
the word ‘face’ as if written ‘fāāce,’ and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
said ‘trōpically’ for ‘trŏpically.’ Also, in a certain
classical drama, addressing the Roman guard, he
desired them to lower their ‘faces’ (meaning their
‘fasces’).</p>

<p>But, whatever may be the recognised standard
of pronunciation, there always will be a refined
and a vulgar mode of speech&mdash;one adopted by the
cultivated and well-informed, and the other used
by the rude and illiterate. It must be understood
that there are only two ways in which our pronunciation
may be at fault. 1. The accent may
be placed on the wrong syllable; or, 2. a wrong
sound may be given to the vowels. Under the
first head may be placed such faults as the following:&mdash;Some
will say ‘fánatic’ instead of ‘fanátic,’
and perhaps as often ‘lunátic’ for ‘lúnatic.’ Again,
‘mischíevous’ is wrong, both in accent and tone; for
the accent should here be on the first syllable, and
the sound of the second should be close&mdash;míschĭevous.
We also not unfrequently hear people call the
word ‘extánt,’ instead of ‘éxtant;’ but, as the accent
is always on the first in words of a like formation&mdash;such
as ‘cónstant,’ ‘dístant,’ ‘ínstant,’ &amp;c.&mdash;there
is no good reason why ‘éxtant’ should be
made an exception. Another word in which the accent
is often misplaced is ‘réspĭted.’ Many will say
‘respíted,’ which is decidedly against good usage.</p>

<p>In some words the accent still seems to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
unsettled. Perhaps we hear the word ‘óbdurate’
as often with the accent on the second as on the
first syllable. Many scholars pronounce the word
‘obdūrate,’ probably because the <em>u</em> is long in the
Latin ‘dūrus;’ but this must also follow the accent
of similar forms. We always say ‘áccŭrate,’
‘índŭrate,’ ‘áugŭrate,’ ‘sátŭrate,’ &amp;c.; and therefore,
by analogy, it should be óbdŭrate.’</p>

<p>By many the accent is placed on the second
syllable of the word ‘applicable;’ but the general
custom is to lay it on the first, and the best practice
is to say ‘ápplicable,’ and not ‘applícable.’</p>

<p>Another case of wrong tone may be heard in
the pronunciation of the word ‘<em>ínfĭnĭte</em>.’ We
still not unfrequently hear in the pulpit, ‘infinīte
goodness,’ &amp;c. In dissyllables ‘īte’ final is sometimes
pronounced long; as in ‘polīte,’ ‘finīte,’
‘recīte,’ &amp;c.; but in words of more than two syllables
the final ‘ite’ is, with few exceptions,
pronounced short. We always (properly) say
‘definĭte,’ ‘exquisĭte,’ ‘opposĭte,’ ‘favourĭte,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>Many have special difficulties in the pronunciation
of certain consonants. The correct sound of
<em>r</em> is a medium between the strong rough <em>R</em> of
the Irish, and the feeble indistinct tone given it
by the London cockney. The Irishman will tell
you that he is very ‘wa<em>r</em>(u)m’ after his ‘wo<em>r</em>(u)k.’
But in London, one often hears, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
‘garden,’ ‘g<em>au</em>den,’ for ‘forth’ ‘f<em>au</em>th,’ and for
‘card’ ‘c<em>au</em>d,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>Many Englishmen have a difficulty in pronouncing
the rough <em>r</em>, substituting for it the sound of <em>w</em>.
These say ‘<em>w</em>oom’ for ‘<em>r</em>oom,’ ‘p<em>w</em>oduct’ for ‘p<em>r</em>oduct,’
‘<em>w</em>agged’ for ‘<em>r</em>agged,’ &amp;c. This habit,
unless checked early, is likely to become incurable.</p>

<p>Others again contract a vicious habit of pronouncing
the <em>r</em> far back in the throat, instead of
forming it by vibrating the tip of the tongue.
This is what the French call ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parler gras</i>.’</p>

<p>There is one very improper use of <em>r</em> which must
be here mentioned; viz. the addition of this letter
to certain words ending in <em>a</em>. Some pronounce
‘sofa’ as if written ‘sofa<em>r</em>.’ Also they speak of
their papa<em>r</em> and mamma<em>r</em>, &amp;c. It is scarcely necessary
to say that this is a positive vulgarism.</p>

<p>Nowhere, perhaps, is the perversity of our nature
more evident than in the pronunciation of,
(1), <em>h</em> silent and <em>h</em> aspirate; and, (2), <em>v</em> and <em>w</em>.
These sounds are constantly confounded. Many
pronounce <em>h</em> where it is not required, and leave it
out where it should be sounded. They will say
‘abit’ for ‘habit,’ ‘erd’ for ‘herd,’ ‘ill’ for ‘hill,’
‘old’ for ‘hold,’ &amp;c.; and, on the other hand,
‘<em>h</em>all’ for ‘all,’ ‘<em>h</em>odd’ for ‘odd,’ ‘<em>h</em>uncle’ for
‘uncle,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>The same vice exists in the pronunciation of <em>v</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and <em>w</em>. It is clear that the speaker <em>can</em> pronounce
both these letters, but he inveterately persists in
misplacing them. He will say ‘<em>w</em>eal’ and ‘<em>w</em>inegar,’
and at the same time, ‘<em>V</em>y do you <em>v</em>eep?’
These faults are made almost exclusively by ignorant,
uneducated people.</p>

<p>Under this head may be also mentioned the
incorrect pronunciation of <em>wh</em> initial. By many
the <em>h</em> is here left out altogether, and these pronounce
the pronoun <em>which</em> exactly as if written
‘<em>witch</em>.’ In Anglo-Saxon, whence all this class of
words comes, they were spelled, and probably
pronounced, with the <em>h</em> first&mdash;‘<em>hw</em>;’ and even now,
if we listen attentively to those who pronounce
them correctly, we shall always hear the aspirate
first. We should surely make a difference between
‘<em>wh</em>o’ and ‘<em>w</em>oo,’ ‘<em>wh</em>en’ and ‘<em>w</em>en,’ ‘<em>wh</em>ere’ and
‘<em>w</em>ear,’ &amp;c.; and, though it would be incorrect to
mark the aspirate too roughly, the <em>h</em> in such words
should be always fairly brought out.</p>

<p>We also perpetually hear (especially in London)
words ending in ‘<em>ing</em>’ pronounced as if written
‘<em>in</em>;’ as, for example, ‘stand<em>in</em>,’ ‘runn<em>in</em>,’ ‘go<em>in</em>,’
for ‘stand<em>ing</em>,’ ‘runn<em>ing</em>,’ go<em>ing</em>,’ &amp;c. In one case a
<em>k</em> is put for the g. ‘Nothin<em>k</em>’ is said for ‘nothing.’</p>

<p>There is a disposition in many readers and
speakers to give a sort of veiled sound to unaccented
monosyllables, so that the true pure tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of the vowel is not heard. This is a very common
fault. By such readers ‘for’ is pronounced ‘<em>fur</em>,’
‘of’ is called ‘<em>uv</em>,’ ‘not’ ‘<em>nut</em>,’ ‘from’ ‘<em>frum</em>,’
and ‘was’ ‘<em>wuz</em>,’ &amp;c. &amp;c. It should be remembered
that, whether such words be, or be not,
accented, the sound of the vowel should always be
full and pure.</p>

<p>A point of great importance is to always carefully
give the true sound to an unaccented vowel
which begins a word. We should never let <em>e</em>motion
degenerate into ‘<em>imm</em>otion,’ ‘<em>e</em>mergency’ into
‘<em>imm</em>ergency,’ ‘<em>o</em>bedience’ into ‘<em>ub</em>bedience,’ &amp;c.
No accent, however, should be placed on these
syllables, but the initial vowel should be always
pronounced in its proper and pure sound.</p>

<p>It is right to be just as careful with vowels
which are medial and unaccented. We should not
allow ‘mon<em>u</em>ment’ to sound as ‘mon<em>i</em>ment,’ nor
must ‘calc<em>u</em>late’ be pronounced with the u close.
This fault often happens with words ending in ‘<em>e</em>ty’
or ‘<em>i</em>ty.’ We hear over and over again, in the pulpit,
the words ‘trin<em>i</em>ty,’ ‘dign<em>i</em>ty,’ ‘soci<em>e</em>ty,’ &amp;c. pronounced
as if written ‘trin<em>a</em>ty,’ ‘dign<em>a</em>ty,’ ‘soci<em>a</em>ty,’
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The pronunciation of the word ‘knowledge,’
with the o long, is still occasionally heard; but it
is now almost universally called ‘knŏwledge’ (to
rhyme with ‘college’).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Some pronounce ‘haunt,’ ‘jaunt,’ ‘taunt,’ ‘jaundice,’
&amp;c. with the diphthong broad, having the
same sound as in ‘r<em>aw</em>’ or ‘s<em>aw</em>.’ But all these
should rhyme with ‘aunt,’ which is never pronounced
broad.</p>

<p>The ending ‘<em>ile</em>’ of certain adjectives sometimes
offers a difficulty of pronunciation. Here, in the
words ‘hostīle,’ ‘missīle,’ ‘servīle,’ ‘reptīle,’ ‘puerīle,’
and ‘volatīle’ the <em>i</em> has a long sound; but
in ‘fertĭle,’ ‘fragĭle,’ ‘futĭle,’ and ‘imbecĭle’ the <em>i</em>
must be short.</p>

<p>Some incorrectly give the long sound ‘īle’ to
the broader diphthong ‘<em>oi</em>l.’ They call ‘<em>oi</em>l’ ‘īle,’
‘boil’ and ‘broil’ ‘bīle’ and ‘brīle,’ &amp;c. In the
age of the poet Pope, these two sounds were probably
closer to each other than they are now; for
he makes ‘<em>join</em>’ rhyme with ‘<em>line</em>:‘&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">While expletives their feeble aid do <em>join</em>,</p>
<p class="verse">And ten low words oft creep in one dull <em>line</em>.</p>
</div></div>

<p>A story is told of some one dining at a tavern
who was asked by the waiter whether he wished
to have his sole ‘<em>brīled</em>?’ To which he replied
that he did not care whether it was ‘brīled’ or
‘bīled,’ as long as it was not ‘spīled!!’</p>

<p>The words ‘fast,’ ‘past,’ ‘mast,’ and other similar
combinations are often pronounced either too
broad or too close. In the provinces we often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
hear ‘m<em>au</em>ster,’ ‘f<em>au</em>st,’ ‘p<em>au</em>st,’ and ‘c<em>au</em>nt,’ whilst
the affected Londoner says ‘m<em>ĕ</em>ster,’ ‘f<em>ĕ</em>st,’ ‘p<em>ĕ</em>st,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>Neither of the two is right, but the proper pronunciation
lies between them. Again, ‘pūt’
(which rhymes with ‘foot’) must not be called
‘pŭt’ (to rhyme with ‘bŭt’), nor must pūlpit be
called pŭlpit. Some persist in pronouncing ‘covetous’
as if written ‘covet<em>i</em>ous,’ and ‘tremendous’
as ‘tremend<em>i</em>ous;’ and these are apparently
equally attached to ‘pron<em>ou</em>nciation’ and ‘ar<em>e</em>thmetic.’
Lastly, the participle of the verb ‘to be’
must always sound exactly like the vegetable
‘bēan,’ and not as a wine-‘bin.’</p>

<p>The letter <em>u</em>, in many words, is really a diphthong,
and has the double sound of e + oo. This
is heard in such words as ‘tüne,’ ‘stüpid,’ ‘tübe,’
‘prodüce,’ ‘solitüde,’ ‘pictüre,’ &amp;c., which should
be sounded as if written ‘te + une,’ ‘ste + upid,’
‘te + ube,’ &amp;c., the one part uttered rapidly after
the other. But many pronounce such words, incorrectly,
as if written ‘toone,’ ‘stoopid,’ ‘pict<em>er</em>,’
&amp;c. This is a vicious cockney pronunciation.</p>

<p>There is no termination we should be more
careful to pronounce fairly out than ‘<em>ow</em>’ final,
which, when unaccented, frequently degenerates
into ‘<em>er</em>.’ The words are properly pronounced
‘wid<em>ow</em>,’ ‘wind<em>ow</em>,’ and ‘fell<em>ow</em>,’ &amp;c., and not ‘widd<em>er</em>,’
‘wind<em>er</em>,’ and ‘fell<em>er</em>!!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The word ‘tobacc<em>o</em>’ also is often wrongly pronounced
‘tobacc<em>er</em>.’</p>

<p>Some, who would be over-refined in their pronunciation,
make two syllables (instead of one) of
the words ‘sky,’ ‘kind.’ They expand them into
‘ske-y,’ ‘key-ind,’ &amp;c. This is an absurd affectation.</p>

<p>A clear distinct articulation is an essential
principle of a correct pronunciation; for, unless
every syllable be uttered clearly, the word cannot
have its proper effect. How often do we hear
careless readers and speakers push one monosyllable
into another, so as to convey the impression
that there is but one word, where, in fact,
there are two. How often do we hear: ‘<em>Frin</em> this
case,’ instead of ‘<em>For</em> in this case;’ ‘<em>Fra</em> time,’ for
‘<em>For</em> a time;’ ‘<em>Nevery</em> occasion,’ for ‘<em>On</em> every
occasion;’ ‘<em>Tinders</em>,’ for ‘<em>It</em> hinders!’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>Special care should be taken to utter <em>unaccented</em>
syllables distinctly; as these are the most
likely to be neglected. It is this neglect which
produces such bad pronunciations as ‘reg’lar,’
‘sing’lar,’ ‘sim’lar,’ and which makes ‘extr<em>a</em>ordinary,’
‘extr<em>or</em>dinary;’ ‘us<em>u</em>al,’ ‘uzhal;’ and
‘vi<em>o</em>lent,’ ‘vilent.’ It is from the same cause
that the <em>d</em> in ‘and’ (a word which is seldom accented)
is so frequently unheard, especially when
the following word begins with a vowel, in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
forms as ‘He <em>an I</em>,’ for ‘He <em>and</em> I;’ ‘My uncle <em>an</em>
aunt,’ for ‘my uncle <em>and</em> aunt,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Irish have several peculiarities of pronunciation,
which must be here noticed.</p>

<p>1. They sound ‘ea’ (the long ē) as ‘ay;’
‘plēase’ they pronounce exactly as ‘plays,’ and
‘tēa’ as ‘tay.’</p>

<p>2. ‘Door’ and ‘floor’ properly rhyme with
‘more’ and ‘sore,’ but the Irish give to these
words the sound of ‘oo’ in ‘poor.’</p>

<p>3. They also pronounce ‘catch’ (which exactly
rhymes with ‘match’) as ‘ketch’ (to rhyme with
‘fetch’). This is also a vulgar pronunciation in
England.</p>

<p>4. They give the short instead of the more open
sound of <em>u</em> in the words ‘pudding,’ ‘cushion,’
and ‘foot.’ They make ‘pudding’ rhyme with
‘sŭdden;’ ‘cushion’ with ‘rush on;’ and ‘foot’
with ‘but.’ They also give the same sound to
the vowels in ‘strōve’ and ‘drōve,’ making them
rhyme with ‘lŏve’ and ‘dŏve,’ and pronouncing
them as if they were written ‘struv’ and ‘druv.’</p>

<p>5. Another of their peculiarities is to leave out
the ‘<em>g</em>’ in ‘strength’ and ‘length,’ pronouncing
these words as if they were written ‘strenth’ and
‘lenth.’ They also omit the ‘<em>d</em>,’ in pronouncing
‘breadth,’ and call it ‘breth.’</p>

<p>6. They give the long sound of ‘<em>e</em>’ to the close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
‘<em>i</em>’ in such words as ‘del<em>i</em>cious,’ ‘mal<em>i</em>cious,’
‘v<em>i</em>cious,’ &amp;c., and call them ‘del<em>ee</em>cious,’ ‘mal<em>ee</em>cious,’
‘v<em>ee</em>cious.’</p>

<p>7. They pronounce ‘<em>o</em>’ before ‘<em>ld</em>’ like the ‘<em>ow</em>’
in ‘how,’ and they pronounce ‘cold’ and ‘bold’
as if these words rhymed with ‘howled’ or
‘growled.’</p>

<span class="fs40">SLANG WORDS AND AMERICANISMS.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">No language is, or ever has been, in the strict
sense of the word, <em>pure</em>. All languages are continually
borrowing and lending&mdash;adopting words
from foreign sources, and contributing from their
own store to that of others. It is now well known
that the ancient Greeks borrowed largely from the
Oriental tongues, and lent words and forms to
Latin. Latin, again, borrowed from Greek, and
contributed to form the modern Italian, Spanish,
and French. The modern German language is
just now strongly affected by a French influence;
and French itself, though for the most part Latin,
contains many Celtic and not a few Germanic
words. Spanish, which is in the main Latin, has
a very considerable admixture of Arabic, brought
in by the Moors in the eighth century; and
English is well known to be made up of Anglo-Saxon,
Norman, French, and Latin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>But languages are not only subject to these attacks
from without, a process of internal corruption
is also set up, and appears in various forms.
One of these may be recognised in the principle of
contraction. It may be laid down as a rule that
words, as they grow older, degenerate in meaning
and contract in form. This contraction probably
originated in a loose, careless way of speaking,
which afterwards affected the written language.
Sometimes a letter or syllable is cut off from the
beginning of a word; sometimes one is taken from
the middle, or from the end. ‘<em>Bus</em>’ is now all we
have left (at any rate, in ordinary conversation)
of ‘<em>omnibus</em>.’ ‘<em>Fantasy</em>’ has lost its middle syllable,
and appears as ‘<em>fancy</em>’ and ‘<em>cab</em>’ does duty
for ‘<em>cabriolet</em>.’ One conclusion this result enables
us to draw is that the contracted forms are always
the more modern. The form ‘courtesy’ existed
before ‘curtsy;’ ‘procurator’ preceded ‘proctor;’
and ‘minute’ was known before ‘mite.’ Whether
these contractions are to be regarded favourably
or otherwise may be a question, but there is no
doubt that they are all produced by the operation
of a natural law of language which no human
power will ever be able to prevent.</p>

<p>When a word is warped or distorted from its
original form, either by a vicious or slovenly pronunciation,
or from a mistaken notion of its derivation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
it is said to be a corruption. One of these
corruptions appears in our word ‘surgeon.’ The
French ‘chirurgien,’ from which it immediately
comes, shows more clearly its Greek origin&mdash;χεὶρ
(cheir), a hand; and ἔργω (ergo), I work&mdash;i.e. a
hand-worker, or manual operator. But a careless
pronunciation, probably aided by a natural tendency
to contraction, has caused the word with us
to dwindle down to ‘surgeon.’</p>

<p>As an illustration of corruption arising from a
false notion of its derivation, we may take the
word ‘i<em>s</em>land.’ How did the <em>s</em> get into it? This <em>s</em>
is not sounded, and yet it must be written. In the
one word ‘island,’ there is a mixture of Latin and
German. The first syllable is of Romance, and
the second of Teutonic origin. The Latin for
‘island’ is ‘insula,’ from ‘in’ and ‘salo,’ the ‘salt,’
i.e. in the salt (sea, understood). The Anglo-Saxon
word for the same idea was ‘ea-land.’ Here
‘<em>ea</em>’ means ‘water.’ This ‘<em>ea</em>,’ or ‘<em>ey</em>,’ is found
in many names of islands, as ‘Angles<em>ea</em>,’ ‘Jers<em>ey</em>,’
‘Guerns<em>ey</em>,’ &amp;c. ‘<em>Ea</em>-land,’ then meant ‘water-land,’
or ‘land surrounded by water.’ In the
earlier editions of ‘Paradise Lost,’ the word always
appears written ‘iland’ (without the <em>s</em>), which
points more clearly to its Saxon derivation, and is
nearer in spelling to the modern German&mdash;‘Eiland.’
The ‘<em>s</em>’ was afterwards inserted, from a mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
notion that the word was of Latin, and not German,
origin.</p>

<p>A false analogy will sometimes give rise to a
corrupted form of spelling. The past tense of
‘can’ was originally ‘coude,’ not ‘cou<em>l</em>d;’ and
the <em>l</em> was afterwards introduced, from the apparent
analogy of the word to ‘wou<em>l</em>d,’ from ‘will,’
and ‘shou<em>l</em>d,’ from ‘shall.’ This, then, is a corruption.
But, though at first incorrect, the <em>l</em>
must, of course, be now retained.</p>

<p>Proper names, both of places and persons, have
suffered a good deal from this influence. Words
of this class are most likely to be corrupted,
because they are most frequently in the mouths of
the common people. That ‘Birmingham’ should
be called ‘Brummagem,’ ‘Cirencester,’ ‘Siseter,’
and ‘Wavertree,’ ‘Wartree,’ is not surprising
when we remember that these corruptions originated
with those who had often to pronounce, but
seldom, if ever, to write these names. But what
is, perhaps, more strange, many of these corruptions
are now adopted by the upper classes. Thus,
in all ranks of society, the proper name ‘Beauchamp’
is now pronounced ‘Beecham;’ ‘St.
John’ is called ‘Sinjon;’ ‘Cholmondeley’ is pronounced
‘Chumley,’ and ‘Marjoribanks’ ‘Marchbanks.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>


<h3><em>Slang Words.</em></h3>

<p>Among the many signs of the corruption of the
English language, one, which is not the least remarkable,
is the prevalent use of slang words and
phrases. That certain terms should be peculiar
to certain callings, trades, or professions, may be
naturally expected, but that these should be extended
into general conversation, is a corroborative
proof of the strong liking people now have for any
thing unusual or out-of-the-way. One very curious
fact may be here observed. While the style of
most of our periodical writers soars upwards, and
affects the lofty and sublime, that of general conversation
is the very reverse, and sinks to the low
and vulgar.</p>

<p>A difference must be here made between ‘cant’
and ‘slang.’ The first signifies the secret language
of thieves, beggars, and tramps, by which
they endeavour to conceal their evil deeds from
the public. The knowledge and practice of this
kind of language is confined to the above-named
fraternities. But slang consists of those vulgar,
unauthorised terms, which have come into fashion
during the last eighty or ninety years, and which
are not confined to one class, but may be now
heard in almost every grade of society.</p>

<p>In all trades and professions there are certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
terms peculiar to each, which are properly called
‘technical;’ these can hardly be denominated
slang. For example, in the language of actors, a
‘<em>length</em>’ signifies forty-two lines of the part each
has to study for the stage. They say, a part consists
of so many ‘lengths.’ This, and other such
terms, are seldom, if ever, heard beyond the circle
to which they properly belong. But slang is
found in almost all classes of society. That of
high life is drawn from various sources. One of
its phases may be seen in the French words and
forms which would-be fashionable people so delight
in using. To call a breakfast a <em>déjeuner</em> is
absurd, especially as we have a very good word of
our own to express that meal. Leaders of fashion
never speak of the fashionable world; but always
of the ‘beau monde.’ This ‘beau monde,’ they
tell us, give ‘recherchés’ entertainments, attended
by the ‘élite’ of society. Lady <em>So</em>-and-<em>So</em> gave a
‘thé dansant,’ which, of course, ‘went off with
éclat,’ &amp;c. &amp;c. Many so-called fashionable ladies
and gentlemen would, probably, be deeply offended
to hear such language termed slang; but any
words or forms which are not recognised English
certainly deserve to be so stigmatised.</p>

<p>This form of slang is confined chiefly to the
would-be fashionables, and to those writers of
very questionable taste, who use what they think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
funny and startling expressions in a novel and
flippant way. Cookery also has given us much
slang of this sort. If we were to ask, in an
ordinary English hotel, for ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">côtelettes à la jardinière,</span>’
or a ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vol-au-vent à la financière,</span>’ the
people of the house would probably stare at us;
but these and such expressions form the staple of
the style of many popular novelists.</p>

<p>Of parliamentary slang, too, there is no lack of
examples. Lord Palmerston, and Mr. Disraeli are
perhaps better known as <em>Pam</em> and <em>Dizzy</em>, than by
their proper names. A single vote to one candidate
at an election is called a ‘plumper;’ and
those who have boiled a pot in a house, to qualify
themselves to vote, are termed ‘potwallopers.’
Among military men, anyone unusually particular
about his dress or personal appearance, is a
‘dandy’ or a ‘swell.’ They also call a ‘title’ a
‘handle to your name,’ and a kind-hearted, good-natured
fellow is, with them, a ‘trump,’ or a ‘brick.’</p>

<p>The Universities also have their slang terms.
The graduates use ‘crib’ for a house; ‘deadmen’
for empty wine-bottles; ‘governor,’ or ‘relieving-officer,’
for a father; ‘plucked,’ for defeated or
rejected in an examination; and ‘row’ for a
disturbance.</p>

<p>The Eton and Harrow boys make use among
themselves of many slang terms, which are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
often heard outside their bounds; but when they
return home for the holidays, they frequently
infect their sisters with some of their strange
phraseology. A boy will sometimes puzzle his
sisters at home, by asking them if they do not
find his ‘toggery’ absolutely ‘stunning;’ or
what they think of his ‘tile,’ or white ‘choker;’
adding that they are not yet paid for; but that
he supposes the ‘governor’ will have to ‘stump
up,’ or ‘fork out the blunt,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>Lawyers also have their slang; and this is not
surprising, when we remember the many opportunities
they must have of hearing it, from their
connection with the police courts, and with life in
its worst phases. With them, taking the benefit
of the Insolvent Debtors Act, is to be ‘white-washed;’
and to draw up a fraudulent balance-sheet
is to ‘cook’ accounts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But of all the forms of slang, the one most
abundant in variety of terms is the mercantile.
It has been calculated that there are as many as
thirty-six vulgar synonyms for the one simple
word <em>money</em>. The following are a few of them:
‘<em>blunt</em>,’ ‘<em>tin</em>,’ ‘<em>coppers</em>,’ ‘<em>browns</em>,’ ‘<em>shiners</em>,’ ‘<em>yellow-boys</em>,’
‘<em>flimsies</em>’ (bank notes); ‘<em>fivers</em>’ (five pound
notes), &amp;c. &amp;c. In city phraseology, 100,000<em>l.</em>
is called a <em>plum</em>, and one million sterling is a
<em>marigold</em>. On the Stock Exchange buyers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
sellers for the account are called ‘bulls’ and ‘bears:’
a broker who is unable to pay his debts, is there
called ‘a lame duck;’ and, if expelled from the
house, he is said ‘to waddle.’</p>

<p>But though most of these terms will never form
a legitimate part of the English language, some
of them are certainly not considered so vulgar as
others. It is said that the elegant Lord Chesterfield
was the author of the word ‘humbug,’ which,
though it may have been considered as slang in
his day, can hardly be so called now. Another
word, ‘hoax,’ was condemned by Swift as low
and vulgar, this, too, has made its way; and is
now not so revolting to good taste as it probably
was when first used. Both these words, ‘humbug’
and ‘hoax,’ are to be found in Dr. Latham’s
edition of <cite>Johnson’s Dictionary</cite>.</p>

<p>Thackeray immortalised ‘snob’ in his celebrated
‘papers;’ and though the word is not to
be recommended, it must be allowed that it is
very expressive. Lord Cairns, in a speech in
the House of Commons, called ‘dodge’ ‘that
homely but expressive term.’ Nor is ‘crusty,’ in
the sense of ‘peevish,’ so low as it was once
thought. It has long been a question, whether
the word ‘bamboozle’ should be admitted. This
also is to be found in Latham’s <cite>Johnson</cite>, though
it is there entered as ‘colloquial.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>But though it may be allowed to use some of
these terms occasionally in familiar discourse, no
one of any sense or good taste will ever think of
indulging in slang language, either spoken or
written. It is, no doubt, a bad sign of the times,
and much to be deplored, that it is so common.
Some writers have calculated that there are, at
least, three thousand slang terms in common use.
The above are but a few examples of this widespread
corruption. We may regard it, as concerns
our language, in the light of a pest to
society. It takes a long time to clear the atmosphere
from the baneful influences of certain
epidemics. Now, the language of every-day conversation
is suffering from this infectious disease,
and it becomes the duty of every Englishman
who has a proper feeling for his language, to refrain
from this evil himself, and to throw in its
way every possible discouragement.</p>


<h3><em>Americanisms.</em></h3>

<p>The recklessness with which the Americans use
the English language bids fair to flood it with many
new and strange terms. It is very possible that
some of these words may some day take their places
as forming part of the legitimate materials of our
language; and it is also possible, as the Americans
themselves sometimes declare, that some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
words and phrases which are now called American,
are, in reality, genuine English words which have
become obsolete in the mother tongue. But, in
the mean time, they certainly must be regarded
as interlopers&mdash;candidates for an office to which
they are not yet, if they ever will be, entitled.</p>

<p>One rather curious explanation has been given
of the word ‘guess.’ It is well known that the
Americans use it in the sense of <em>to know for certain</em>.
‘I guess’ is equivalent, in American phraseology,
to ‘I know it’&mdash;‘I am sure of it.’ Now, it has
been argued that this is the proper meaning of the
word&mdash;that it is derived from the German ‘gewiss,’
which comes originally from ‘wissen,’ to know.
When first imported into America, in the seventeenth
century, they say that it had this meaning
in English&mdash;that we in England have since then
altered the meaning of the word, and that the
Americans have preserved its original signification.
Even supposing that this could be proved,
it does not follow that the American practice is
the right one; nor, of course, that we should alter
our present meaning of the word, and conform to
the American custom. The fountain-head of the
English language is in England, and in no other
country; and all departures from the English use
of English words must be looked upon as faults
against purity of style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Americanisms may be considered under two
heads&mdash;1st, legitimate English words used in a
wrong sense; and, 2nd, words of a new invention,
mutilated or distorted from some known
or unknown root. In the first class we may place
the adjective ‘tall.’ This the Americans use in a
novel and unrecognised sense. In English it is
properly applied only to concrete nouns; as, ‘a
tall man,’ or ‘a tall tree,’ &amp;c. But, in the United
States, we continually hear of ‘tall talk,’ or even
‘a tall smell,’ &amp;c. It is not the word that is here
objected to, but the sense in which it is applied.
To ‘raise’ is another of this class, which is constantly
used for ‘to educate,’ or ‘bring up.’ ‘Where
were you raised?’ is, in America, a very common
question. Again, the word ‘liquor’ is a perfectly
good English noun; but what a strange innovation
is ‘to liquor!’ A genuine Yankee says, ‘Stranger,
will you “liquor?”’ ‘Handsome,’ ‘clever,’ and
‘fix’ are all three genuine English, but ‘to play
<em>handsome</em> on the flute’ is undoubtedly bad English.
We sometimes qualify persons, but never things,
as ‘clever.’ A ‘clever’ boy, or a ‘clever’ man,
&amp;c., but never, as in America, a ‘clever’ house or
a ‘clever’ cargo. Again, in America a very
common use of ‘to fix’ is ‘to prepare,’ or ‘put in
order.’ This is not sanctioned by English usage.
But ‘a fix,’ in the sense of a dilemma or predicament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
is condemned by literary men in the United
States as a vulgarism.</p>

<p>The other class consists of words wholly unrecognised
in English in any sense&mdash;in fine, genuine
Americanisms; such words as ‘secesh,’ ‘skedaddle,’
‘recuperate,’ ‘rowdy,’ ‘rile,’ ‘stampede,’
&amp;c., which can in no sense be said to belong to our
language. Nor is it likely that English writers of
any pretensions to good taste will ever adopt them.
The Americans call the English ‘Britishers;’ to
tease or vex anyone is, with them, ‘to rile’ him;
to make a set speech is to ‘orate;’ a sudden panic
and flight of soldiers is a ‘stampede,’ &amp;c. There
are other words of this class which it would puzzle
most English writers to explain; such as ‘slick,’
‘spry,’ ‘kedge,’ ‘boss,’ ‘absquatulate,’ &amp;c. These
are not English words, and we may pretty confidently
predict that they will never become English.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt, however, that certain
expressions now known as Americanisms were, at
one time, very commonly used in English. Madame
D’Arblay, as well as other writers of her time,
has, over and over again, ‘mighty fine,’ ‘mighty
pretty,’ &amp;c. ‘Mighty pretty’ is exactly on a par
with ‘<em>uncommon</em> nice.’ The one is just as incorrect
as the other. This is a form of expression continually
used by American writers. Forty or fifty
years ago the adjective ‘rare’ was commonly used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
for ‘underdone’ (meat). Now, though common
enough in the United States, it is seldom, if ever,
applied by us in that sense. Some of these peculiarities
appear to be making way in English, in
spite of our struggles against them. Such are ‘to
progress’ for ‘to advance,’ ‘to effectuate’ for ‘to
accomplish,’ ‘right off,’ or ‘right away,’ for ‘at
once’ or ‘immediately,’ ‘laid over’ for ‘put off,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Americans use ‘tiresome’ for ‘tiring;’ they
speak of a ‘tiresome’&mdash;for a fatiguing&mdash;journey.
Also a ‘good’ time is used for a ‘pleasant’ time,
‘fall’ for ‘autumn,’ and to ‘go-a-head’ for ‘to
prosper.’ One American word which seems likely
to establish itself in the English language is, ‘a
loafer.’ This would seem to be derived from the
German ‘laufen,’ to run, though it has not that
meaning in the United States, where it signifies
one who lounges about lazily.</p>

<p>In America many new terms are the offspring
of a political excitement, which is sure to occur
every four years, i.e. as often as a new President
is elected. On these occasions such words as
‘Copperheads,’ ‘Ring-tailed Roarers,’ ‘Know-nothings,’
‘Fenians,’ ‘Wolverines,’ &amp;c., &amp;c., are
sure to make their appearance. These words may
have a meaning for those who invent and use
them, but to the great majority of Englishmen
they are altogether a mystery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Language, in the hands of a great poet, has
been often called ‘a flame of fire.’ However this
may be, in the hands of certain American journalists
it does seem, now and then, very likely to
burn their own fingers. In the New York papers
we meet with the verb ‘to concertize,’ which may
possibly mean to give a succession of concerts.
We remember hearing that process once called
‘going about matinéeing!’ And there is quite as
good authority for the one as for the other of these
expressions. Another unintelligible phrase, drawn
from the same source, is ‘an <em>emergent</em> meeting.’
This word is never used, in modern English, in a
concrete sense. We may say an <em>emergent</em> occasion
or <em>emergent</em> doubts, but not an <em>emergent</em> candidate
or an <em>emergent</em> character. It is possible that the
writer meant a meeting called together on an
emergency.</p>

<p>The rapid communication established of late
years between England and the United States has
brought the two nations into a much closer connection
with each other. This, in a commercial
or a political view, may be of great advantage to
both countries. But every advantage has its
drawback, and it is very doubtful whether this
condition of things is likely to benefit the English
language. The Americans are well known to set
great store by liberty, and of course we have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
right whatever to interfere with their opinions
concerning principles or forms of political government.
But it becomes a serious matter for us
when they think proper to take liberties with our
language. They set up for themselves, probably
by way of showing their independence, new modes
of spelling; and they are perpetually introducing
all sorts of meanings, words, and phrases, none of
which have the remotest title to be called English.
In the writings of the late N. P. Willis, we meet with
such terms as the following:&mdash;‘An unletupable
nature,’ ‘wideawakeity,’ ‘plumptitude,’ ‘pocketually
speaking,’ ‘betweenity,’ and ‘go-awayness!’
In the same gentleman’s writings, we occasionally
come across such elegant forms of expression as
‘whipping creation,’ ‘flogging Europe,’ ‘a heap
of opinions,’ ‘tarnation quick,’ &amp;c. These and all
such must be looked upon as abortions or deformities
of our language; and no English writer
who has any respect for his own reputation should
ever think of countenancing, far less of adopting,
such monstrosities.</p>

<span class="fs40">GENERAL REMARKS ON WORDS, ETC.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">In old English spelling, we frequently meet with
<em>y</em> initial, where we now use <em>th</em>; as in ‘<em>ye</em> manners
and <em>ye</em> customs,’ &amp;c. This error probably arose
from the blundering of the copyists, who mistook
one letter for another. Down to the close of the
reign of Edward III., two characters of the Saxon
alphabet were in common use, which we have
now rejected; tha (þ) (<em>th</em> hard), and edh (ð)
(<em>th</em> soft). The first of these, (þ), somewhat resembled
a <em>y</em> in shape; and hence the mistake. This is,
probably, the true explanation of the case, as <em>y</em>
was, in all these instances, used where we now
have <em>th</em>.</p>

<p>Y initial, as indicating a participle or an intensive
meaning, has now become obsolete in English.
But it lingered in the language till the seventeenth
century, as may be seen in Milton. ‘In heaven
<em>y</em>clept Euphrosyne.’ This is the <em>ge</em> initial of the
modern German, as in ‘<em>ge</em>kannt,’ ‘<em>ge</em>brochen,’ &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Our word ‘guess,’ is supposed to be connected
with the German ‘gewiss;’ where the initial <em>ge</em>
may be referred to the same source. In comparing
certain German with English words, we
may see that this prefix (<em>g</em> or <em>y</em>) has, in most
cases, fallen off, though in some few words it still
retains its place. The German ‘<em>G</em>lück,’ is in
English ‘luck,’ and the German ‘<em>g</em>leich’ has
become with us ‘like.’ Again,’to <em>g</em>low’ was, in
Saxon, ‘hlowian.’ We retain the <em>g</em> in ‘gleam,’
and ‘glimpse,’ though we lose it in ‘light.’ The
same connection may be observed between the
German ‘<em>g</em>ern,’ and the English ‘<em>y</em>earn.’</p>

<p>Many are puzzled when to use <em>ei</em> and when <em>ie</em> in
the spelling of certain English words, when these
combinations are pronounced as a long <em>e</em>. The
rule is, that when a sibilant (<em>c</em> or <em>s</em>) precedes, <em>ei</em>
is the right spelling; but that when any other
consonant comes before, <em>ie</em> should be written.
Thus, ‘<em>sei</em>ze, con<em>cei</em>ve, <em>cei</em>ling, de<em>cei</em>t,’ &amp;c., must
have <em>ei</em>; whilst ‘be<em>lie</em>ve, pr<em>ies</em>t, <em>chie</em>f, re<em>trie</em>ve,’ &amp;c.,
must be spelled <em>ie</em>. The word ‘siege’ is an exception;
we here adopt the French spelling.</p>

<p>It is generally well known that the prefixes <em>ante</em>
and <em>anti</em> have, in English, each a distinct meaning.
‘Ant<em>e</em>’ is the Latin preposition for ‘before.’
It is found in ‘ant<em>e</em>date’ (to date before);
‘ant<em>e</em>chamber’ (a waiting-room <em>before</em> another);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
‘ant<em>e</em>cedent’ (going <em>before</em>), &amp;c. ‘Anti’ is
originally Greek, and means ‘against.’ It is
found in ‘ant<em>i</em>pathy’ (a feeling <em>against</em>); ‘ant<em>i</em>dote’
(a medicine given <em>against</em>); i.e. as a preventive.
But there is one exception to this explanation;
viz. ‘ant<em>i</em>cipate.’ ‘Anti,’ in this case,
does not mean ‘against,’ but beforehand. To
‘anticipate’ is to enjoy or suffer prospectively.
The Latin <em>i</em> always becomes an <em>e</em> in French; and
vice versâ. This is considered as an organic law
of transformation. The Latin mih<em>i</em>, tib<em>i</em>, sib<em>i</em>,
<em>i</em>n, <em>i</em>nter, &amp;c., are in French m<em>e</em>, t<em>e</em>, s<em>e</em>, <em>e</em>n, <em>e</em>ntre.
On the other hand, the Latin ‘impl<em>ē</em>re,’ ‘fall<em>ĕ</em>re,’
‘leg<em>ĕ</em>re,’ ‘quaer<em>ĕ</em>re,’ and ‘flor<em>ĕ</em>re,’ are in French,
rempl<em>i</em>r, ‘faill<em>i</em>r,’ ‘l<em>i</em>re,’ ‘quér<em>i</em>r,’ and ‘fleur<em>i</em>r.’
This may be seen in ‘antichambre,’ ‘antidater,’ &amp;c.;
and the English has, in this one case, ‘anticipate,’
adopted the French form of spelling.</p>

<p>The difference in pronunciation between such
words as ‘hōme,’ and ‘sŏme;’ ‘bōne’ and ‘dŏne;’
‘alōne’ and ‘gŏne,’ depends on their derivation.
In these cases, the long ō corresponds with the
modern German ‘<em>ei</em>.’ The German ‘Heim’ is the
English ‘hōme.’ ‘Bein’ is in English bōne;
‘allein,’ ‘alōne,’ &amp;c., whereas the closer sound
of <em>ŏ</em> approaches to a closer sound of <em>a</em> or
<em>o</em> in German. Hence, the root <em>sam</em> (as in
<em>sam</em>meln), gives the English ‘sŏme.’ ‘Dŏne’ is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
from ‘gethăn,’ ‘cŏme,’ from ‘kŏmmen,’ &amp;c. From
the same cause, the adverb ‘<em>so</em>’ in English has
the same long sound as in German; whereas ‘<em>tŏ</em>’
and ‘<em>dŏ</em>,’ being from ‘zu’ and ‘thun,’ have a closer
pronunciation.</p>

<p>It is natural to expect that as the genius of a
people powerfully influences the spelling of their
common terms, the same cause should operate in
that of their proper names, both of persons and
places. With respect to names of places, there is
now and then some difficulty. The inhabitants of
a town or country do not always give it the name
by which it is known to foreigners. An English
tourist who is a novice in continental travel,
arrives at a town he has been accustomed to call
‘<em>Aix</em>,’ or ‘Aix-la-Chapelle;’ and he is not a little
puzzled to hear it named ‘<em>Aachen</em>.’ It is doubtful
whether many English would recognise the
German word; and yet it is certainly the one
used by the Prussians from time immemorial.
There are many other continental towns with
whose names we English are, in general, not
familiar; for example, Lüttich (Liège), Regensburg
(Ratisbon), Bruxelles (Brussels), Kiobenhavn
(Copenhagen), Vliessingen (Flushing), Genf
(Geneva), &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>That these differences should exist was but
natural in bygone times when there was so scanty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a communication between one country and another.
But nowadays, when one touch of the telegraph
‘should make the whole world akin,’ and when
steamboats and railroads seem to be literally annihilating
both time and space, it is to be regretted
that some one standard form for the spelling of
names of places should not be agreed on, which all
should adopt, and which would be intelligible to
the whole civilised world. There appears to be
some probability of the continental states adopting
a standard coin which shall have a universal
currency. Why should they not also determine
on one standard form of spelling for the names of
all their towns and districts? The one change
would not be more difficult than the other.</p>

<p>One very striking peculiarity of the English
language is the extraordinary variety of senses in
which many of our words, especially those of
Saxon origin, may be used. A curious instance
of this variety may be seen in the case of the verb
‘to get.’ For example: ‘After I <em>got</em> (received)
your letter; I immediately <em>got</em> (mounted) on
horseback; and when I <em>got</em> to (reached) Canterbury,
I <em>got</em> (procured) a chaise, and proceeded
to town. But, the rain coming on, I <em>got</em>
(caught) such a severe cold, that I could not <em>get</em>
rid of it for some days. When I <em>got</em> home, I
<em>got</em> up-stairs, and <em>got</em> to bed immediately; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the next morning I found I could neither <em>get</em>
down stairs, <em>get</em> my breakfast, nor <em>get</em> out of doors.
I was afraid I should never <em>get</em> over this attack.’
It may be reasonably doubted whether any
English word of Latin or French origin has half
so many and such various significations.</p>

<p>‘<em>To put</em>’ is a verb of unsettled derivation; but
it has an endless variety of meanings: and is
compounded with almost every preposition in the
language. Latham’s edition of <cite>Johnson’s Dictionary</cite>
gives about seventy different senses of this
one verb, some of which are as follows: ‘A man
<em>puts by</em> money when he saves it up; or he <em>puts
away</em> his wife when he divorces her. An insurrection
may be <em>put down</em>; or a man may <em>put down</em>
his name as a subscriber. A tree <em>puts forth</em> leaves,
or a man <em>puts into</em> a lottery. He <em>puts off</em> his
clothes, or he <em>puts off</em> a disagreeable task; he <em>puts
out</em> his money at interest; or he <em>puts out</em> the light
when he goes to bed; and he is terribly <em>put out</em>
when things do not go well with him. He can
<em>put together</em> his thoughts; but he cannot <em>put up</em>
with an insult. It is unpleasant to be <em>put upon</em>;
and sometimes very hard to <em>put</em> things <em>to rights</em>.’</p>

<p>The French adverb très (very), is the Latin
‘trans’ (over, or across.) The prefix ‘trans’ is
of frequent use in English as in ‘transfer,’ ‘transfix,’
‘transform,’ &amp;c. We have adopted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
French ‘très’ in only one word; viz. ‘trespass.’
This signifies either in a physical or moral sense,
‘to pass a boundary.’ It is still used in English,
chiefly as a term of law.</p>

<p>Some writers on language have objected to the
order of words generally adopted in certain colloquial
expressions. They say that in such phrases
as ‘bred and born,’ ‘shoes and stockings,’ ‘coat
and waistcoat,’ &amp;c., we put the cart before the
horse. They would have us say ‘born and bred,’
‘stockings and shoes,’ &amp;c. Their argument is,
that we should put these words in their <em>natural</em>
order, as to time&mdash;that as a man must be born
before he is bred, the proper order is ‘born and
bred,’ and so on, in all other cases of this sort.
This, however, does not seem to be the right view
of the matter. In these expressions it should be
remembered that whatever comes first to our
knowledge, or makes the deepest impression on
the mind, is naturally first uttered. True, a man
must be born before he is bred; but the idea
conveyed in ‘bred’ is first impressed on the
mind, and therefore ‘bred and born’ is the right
order. Again, we see the shoes; we can but
partially see the stockings; and this is why the
usual order is adopted.</p>

<p>Again: we never say ‘the sciences and arts;’
but always ‘the arts and sciences.’ There is here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
also, a very good reason for the general practice.
It must be remembered that the arts were practised
long before the sciences on which they are
built were discovered. Practice always precedes
theory. Language was spoken before grammars
were written; music was played and sung before
the laws of harmony were understood; and therefore,
it is but reasonable that we should put the
‘arts before the sciences.’</p>

<p>It may seem strange that in addressing an
audience, the English always say ‘Ladies and
Gentlemen!’ whereas in France we hear, ‘Messieurs
et Mesdames,’ and in Germany, ‘Meine
Herren und Damen.’ This order may have been
adopted at a time when ladies had not the influence
in society which they now possess. We have not
the reputation for gallantry which our continental
neighbours enjoy; and yet, in this instance, we
may perhaps set them a lesson of politeness.</p>

<p>Connected with this subject may be mentioned
that doubling of terms which occurs in our Liturgy
so frequently, that it may be regarded as a characteristic
of its style. The compilers of our
Church Service, probably in their anxiety to make
the text intelligible even to the commonest understanding,
continually put two nouns or two verbs
together, the second generally explaining the first.
In these cases we shall find one of the terms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
French, or Latin, and the other of Saxon derivation.
This seems to have been done purposely, in
order that, if any of the congregation, especially
the less educated, should not understand the one
term, he should catch the meaning of the other.
In the early prayers of the ‘Morning Service,’ we
have: ‘We <em>pray</em> and <em>beseech</em> thee.’ We also find
‘We <em>acknowledge</em> and <em>confess</em>,’ ‘<em>sins</em> and <em>wickedness</em>;’
‘<em>goodness</em> and <em>mercy</em>;’ ‘<em>dissemble</em> nor <em>cloak</em>;’
‘<em>assemble</em> and <em>meet together</em>;’ ‘<em>requisite</em> and <em>necessary</em>;’
‘<em>erred</em> and <em>strayed</em>;’ ‘<em>pardoneth</em> and <em>absolveth</em>,’
and many others.</p>

<p>Certain writers on the English language have
strongly objected to the lately-introduced practice
of forming participial adjectives from nouns;
especially in the case of the two words ‘talented’
and ‘gifted.’ As well, say they, might we call a
man ‘wisdomed,’ ‘geniused,’ or ‘knowledged.’
Coleridge, arguing against the admission of the
word ‘talented’ into English, says: ‘only imagine
other participles so formed, and conceive a man
being said to be ‘pennied,’ ‘shillinged,’ and
‘pounded!’ But though we do not yet use these
latter terms, Coleridge seems to have forgotten
that we very commonly speak of a ‘moneyed’
man; and there is very little doubt that these
adjectives have struck too deep root in the language
to be easily eradicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>The word ‘<em>reliable</em>,’ a comparatively late introduction,
is another of those against which the
purists have raised a loud outcry. They argue
that as we do not rely a man, but rely <em>on</em> a man,
therefore the word, if used at all, should be ‘reli<em>on</em>able,’
and not ‘reliable.’ But here is one of the
many cases in which philosophy must give way to
custom; and, in spite of the above objection, this
word is too firmly fixed in the language to be
easily driven out. The real difference between
‘reliable’ and ‘trustworthy’ is, that the former
applies more property to things, such as news, information,
&amp;c., and the latter to persons. A ‘trustworthy’
messenger would probably bring us ‘reliable’
information. But, whatever concession we
may make in the case of ‘reliable,’ we should resist,
with all our might, the introduction of ‘reliability.’</p>

<p>Certain laws of transformation are found to
operate in the Romance languages. One of these
is, that Latin or Italian words beginning with <em>f</em>
appear in Spanish with an <em>h</em> initial. Thus ‘filius,’
‘figlio’ (a son), is, in Spanish, ‘hijo.’ By the
same law the Latin ‘femina’ (a woman) becomes,
in Spanish ‘hembra,’ ‘formosus’ (beautiful) is
‘<em>h</em>ermoso,’ ‘Fabulari,’ Italian ‘favellare’ (to talk)
is, in Spanish, ‘hablar.’ ‘Faba’ (a bean) is, in
Spanish, ‘haba.’ The Latin ‘Facere,’ Italian
‘fare’ (to do), becomes ‘<em>h</em>acer,’ filum (thread) is
‘hilo,’ and folium (a leaf) ‘hoja,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spanish word ‘hidalgo’ (a nobleman) is a
contraction of ‘<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">hijo d’algo</span>’ (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">filius alicujus</span>), literally
‘the son of somebody,’ i.e., of importance.</p>

<p>It may also be observed that the combination <em>ct</em>
in Latin is found in Italian <em>tt</em> (or <em>t</em>), and in Spanish
<em>ch</em>. This may be seen in the following cases:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl wd30">&nbsp; Lat.</td><td class="tdl wd30">Ital.</td><td class="tdl">Span.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Dire<em>ct</em>us</td><td class="tdl">diri<em>tt</em>o</td><td class="tdl">dere<em>ch</em>o</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Again, <em>pl</em> in Latin becomes <em>pi</em> in Italian and <em>ll</em> in
Spanish, as in the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl wd30">&nbsp; Lat.</td><td class="tdl wd30">Ital.</td><td class="tdl">Span.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"><em>Pl</em>anctus</td><td class="tdl"><em>pi</em>anto</td><td class="tdl"><em>ll</em>anto</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Affinities also exist between certain letters of the
alphabet; and this relationship may be often seen
in words transferred from one language to another.
For example, the labials, or lip-letters, are frequently
interchanged. Many English words beginning
with an F are derived from Latin (or
French) words having a <em>P</em> initial. This is exemplified
in the following list:&mdash;</p>

<p>Another affinity may be observed between <em>G</em> and
<em>W</em>. Many French words beginning with a <em>G</em>
guttural represent that letter in English by a <em>W</em>.
This may be seen in the following cases:&mdash;</p>

with German words.</p>

<p>A relationship is also to be seen between <em>C</em> guttural
and <em>H</em> aspirate. The <em>C</em> hard initial in the
Romance languages is represented in the Teutonic
by an <em>H</em>. For example:&mdash;</p>

<p>This connection between <em>c</em> (or <em>k</em>) and <em>h</em> appears
in other cases. A primitive English word ending
in a guttural (<em>g</em> or <em>k</em>) often produces derivatives
in which the guttural is softened into <em>tch</em>, as in:&mdash;</p>

<p>Some are puzzled when to spell the ending
‘ledge’ and when ‘lege.’ The following rule may
be easily remembered:&mdash;Monosyllables and the
word ‘acknowle<em>d</em>ge’ are spelled with a <em>d</em>; therefore
‘le<em>d</em>ge,’ ‘fle<em>d</em>ge,’ ‘ple<em>d</em>ge,’ ‘se<em>d</em>ge,’ ‘sle<em>d</em>ge,’ and
‘acknowle<em>d</em>ge’ retain that letter; whereas ‘sacrilege,’
‘privilege,’ ‘allege,’ and ‘college’ must
reject it.</p>

<p>Some years ago, there was a sharp controversy
concerning the spelling of the word&mdash;whether it
should be ‘<em>rein</em>-deer’ or ‘<em>rain</em>-deer.’ The dictionaries
differed, many even giving both forms.
It was found in Johnson ‘r<em>a</em>in-deer,’ which of
course settled the dispute. In spite of this decision,
there is no doubt that the word is generally spelled
‘rein-deer.’ The Saxon form was ‘hr<em>a</em>na-deor,’
i.e. ‘the running animal.’</p>

<p>Some lament that we have adopted the French
form of the word ‘programme.’ They say that by
analogy it ought to be written ‘program.’ We
have ‘anagram,’ ‘diagram,’ ‘epigram,’ &amp;c.; and
why not ‘program?’ But the former is now the
established spelling; and, till some daring innovator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
adopt the new form, and his example be generally
followed, we must be content to use the old
one.</p>

<p>A few years ago, a new word was wanted to
express ‘a message sent by the telegraph;’ various
forms were suggested, but at last the word ‘telegram’
was adopted. This was another argument
in favour of ‘program.’</p>

<p>The verb ‘to repair,’ in the sense of ‘to make
better’ or ‘to improve,’ is from the Latin ‘reparare,’
through the French ‘réparer;’ but when
it means ‘to go back home’ it is from the Latin
‘repatriare,’ to return to your country.</p>

<p>The second syllable in ‘impair’ is in no way
connected with the above. ‘Impair’ is from the
French ‘<em>empirer</em>,’ ‘to make worse.’</p>

<span class="fs40"><span class="smcap">GENERAL REMARKS ON WORDS, ETC.</span>&mdash;<em>continued.</em></span></h2>


<p class="noindent">In the periodical and light literature of the day,
we frequently meet with forms of language which
have been expressively called ‘slipshod English.’
These are of various kinds&mdash;uncertain reference,
superfluous words, incompatible terms, ungrammatical
forms, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of the first class may be quoted the tailor’s
advertisement, in which it was stated that
‘Gentlemen’s materials are made up, and waited
on at their own houses,’ where there is a glorious
uncertainty as to who or what may be
waited on.</p>

<p>The following is of the same nature:&mdash;In an
examination in the House of Commons, in 1809, a
member said that ‘the witness had been ordered
to withdraw from the bar, in consequence of
being intoxicated by the motion of an honourable
member.’ The word ‘intoxicated’ was here, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the right word; but it was certainly not in
the right place.</p>

<p>A word is often written which has no function
to perform in the sentence, and therefore no business
on the paper. These are superfluous words;
they occupy space, but, instead of assisting, they
rather clog the sense of the passage. The often-used
expression, ‘final completion,’ is a case in
point. Every ‘completion’ is ‘final;’ the idea
of ‘final’ is involved in the word ‘completion,’
and therefore this is a wrong expression.</p>

<p>Another of these superabundant forms is where
we find ‘universal’ and ‘all’ brought into the
same construction. A man is sometimes said to
be ‘universally’ beloved by ‘all’ his friends.
Here either ‘universally’ or ‘all’ should be taken
out. If the love for him is ‘universal,’ of course
‘all’ love him; and the converse is equally true.</p>

<p>Sometimes words are found together which contradict
each other. Of this class of faults we may
quote the not unfrequent form ‘further backwards.’
‘Further’ means more in advance, and ‘backwards’
has a directly contrary meaning. It is
impossible to go ‘further’ and, at the same time,
‘backwards,’ and therefore the two words should
never be used together.</p>

<p>‘Either’ and ‘neither’ cannot be properly applied
to more than two persons or things. Speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of three or four people, it is incorrect to say that
‘neither’ of them is clever, though we may say
that ‘none,’ or ‘no one,’ of them is clever. Nor
would it be good grammar to say, ‘either of the
six children may go;’ we must here say ‘any one.’</p>

<p>‘<em>All of them.</em>’ This is a form which some critics
have attacked, and not without reason. They say
that ‘<em>of</em>’ here means ‘out of;’ that it corresponds
exactly with the Latin preposition <em>e</em>, or <em>ex</em>, and
that therefore the expression must be incorrect.
We do not take ‘all of them,’ but we take ‘them
all.’ We may correctly say one, two, three, &amp;c.,
or most of them, but when there is question of
<em>all</em>, no preposition should be used.</p>

<p>‘<em>Equanimity of mind.</em>’ As equanimity means
evenness of mind, why should ‘of mind’ be repeated?
‘Anxiety of mind’ is, of course, open to
the same objection.</p>

<p>‘<em>Incorrect orthography.</em>’ The fault in this very
common expression arises from the idea that ‘orthography’
means merely spelling (good or bad),
whereas the true meaning of the word is ‘<em>correct</em>
spelling.’ Now, spelling cannot be correct and at
the same time incorrect, and therefore the two
terms are incompatible. We may say ‘incorrect
spelling,’ but we must not say ‘incorrect orthography.’</p>

<p>‘<em>A confirmed invalid.</em>’ What is this? one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
is strengthened in his weakness? There is certainly
here a contradiction, for no weakness can
be strong.</p>

<p>‘<em>Old news</em>’ is another contradictory form, where
the terms are incompatible with each other. It
may be placed in the same class with ‘enjoying
bad health.’</p>

<p>It is inaccurate to say that a man’s ‘<em>defects are
improved</em>.’ A defect means the want of some good
quality, and to ‘improve’ means ‘to make better.’
Wants may be ‘decreased’ or ‘supplied,’ but they
cannot be made better; and, therefore, the two
terms should not be used together.</p>

<p>It is a common error to use ‘quantity’ for
‘number.’ The former can only be said of a collection
or mass. A ‘quantity’ of meat or a
‘quantity’ of milk is good English, but not a quantity
of pens or books, &amp;c. To separate individual
objects we must apply ‘number,’ but to a collected
mass ‘quantity.’ We may say a ‘quantity’ of
wood, but it must be a ‘number’ of faggots.</p>

<p>In many cases the wrong preposition is used;
and, indeed, there are few writers or speakers who
are invariably correct in this respect. The very
common fault, ‘different to,’ we need hardly stop
to inquire into, but we often find equally wrong
forms which pass unnoticed. Occasionally we
meet with ‘to disagree <em>from</em>,’ though in general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the form used is ‘to disagree <em>with</em>.’ Here the
‘dis’ in ‘disagree’ and the preposition ‘with’
seem to pull two ways. Which, then, is right&mdash;to
disagree <em>from</em> or <em>with</em>? The proper phrase is to
‘assent <em>to</em>’ and to ‘dissent <em>from</em>;’ and if the latter
is correct, why not also ‘to disagree <em>from</em>?’</p>

<p>As it is admitted that ‘different <em>to</em>’ is wrong,
on the same principle, ‘averse <em>to</em>’ must be wrong.
No one can go two ways at once. The <em>a</em> in
‘averse’ certainly means ‘from;’ and therefore
the word should be followed by ‘<em>from</em>,’ and not ‘<em>to</em>.’
The first is already adopted by many good writers.</p>

<p>The conjunction ‘than’ should not be used
except after a comparative adjective. ‘Soon<em>er</em>
than;’ ‘better than;’ ‘rather than,’ &amp;c., are
correct; but ‘scarcely had he uttered these words
<em>than</em>,’ is bad English. ‘Hardly had he attained
his majority <em>than</em>’ is equally wrong. For ‘<em>than</em>’
we should here use ‘<em>when</em>.’ ‘But’ should not be
used for ‘than,’ as, ‘no sooner had he finished his
work <em>but</em>.’</p>

<p>Another common mistake is to use ‘except’ for
‘unless.’ The former is a preposition, and must be
followed not by a proposition, but by a noun or
pronoun. It is bad grammar to say ‘no one
should aspire to this situation, <em>except</em> he is competent
to fulfil its duties.’ (Here, we should read
‘unless’ for ‘except.’)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Like’ is also frequently confounded with ‘as.’
The former is a preposition, and should not be
used as a conjunction. ‘Do you write <em>like</em> I do?’
is wrong. It should be ‘<em>as</em> (not <em>like</em>) I do.’</p>

<p>‘Notwithstanding he thought so,’ is bad English.
We should here use ‘although.’ ‘Notwithstanding’
is a preposition, and is followed by its object.
We say correctly, ‘notwithstanding his objections,’
but not properly, ‘notwithstanding he objected.’</p>

<p>‘But’ is often redundant after the word ‘doubt.’
We continually meet with ‘I have no doubt <em>but</em>
that,’ &amp;c. This is a wrong form: the ‘but’ should
be omitted.</p>

<p>As an example of a loose sentence; i.e. where
the connection of the parts is not sufficiently
clear, the following advertisement of a hair-dresser
may be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Seven lessons in hair-dressing may be had for
one guinea, which (?) <em>being imparted on a system</em>
entirely new, will enable any one <em>so instructed</em> to
give the most complete satisfaction!’</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon ‘tíd’ meant ‘time’ (compare
the German ‘Zeit’); whence to ‘betide’ means to
happen in time. The ‘tide’ is the <em>time</em> at which
the water rises and falls. ‘Tidy,’ also, in old
English, signified properly ‘timely.’</p>

<p>In old English, we meet with the form ‘ton,’
which is for ‘the one;’ and this may probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
account for ‘t’other,’ or ‘the t’other,’ which is,
in fact, a contraction of ‘that other.’ But ‘t’other’
is now accounted a vulgarism.</p>

<p>There is some difference of practice in the
use of the article (a, an). The rule is, that
‘an’ must be used before a vowel, or <em>h</em> mute.
This is, in general, a good rule; but there
is one vowel, which must be sometimes considered
an exception, viz. ‘<em>u</em>.’ It is right to
say ‘an apple,’ ‘an evil,’ ‘an idler,’ and ‘an
orange;’ but before <em>u</em> we must pause; for here
there is a double practice. Now, this vowel has
two sounds; open, as in ‘<em>u</em>nion;’ and close,
as in ‘<em>u</em>gly.’ Before the long sound, we should
use the article ‘a;’ as ‘a unit,’ ‘a union,’ ‘a
uniform,’ &amp;c. But before the short sound of ‘u,’
the article ‘an’ should be used; as ‘an uncle,’
‘an ugly object,’ &amp;c. Many good writers, however,
use ‘an’ even before a long <em>u</em>. We often
meet with ‘<em>an</em> united family,’ ‘<em>an</em> universal practice,’
&amp;c. The question is here one of harmony;
and the best practice seems to be, to adopt the
softer sound. No one ever thinks of saying or
writing ‘<em>an</em> youth,’ or ‘<em>an</em> yew tree;’ and yet
the sound in ‘<em>an</em> uniform,’ or ‘<em>an</em> universe,’ is
precisely the same, and of course equally harsh.</p>

<p>Another case belonging to this question is the
use of the article in the frequently-seen expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
‘<em>such an one</em>.’ This form is disagreeably harsh
and unmusical. We might as well say: ‘such <em>an</em>
woman,’ or ‘such <em>an</em> wonder.’ It is true there
are authorities for both these forms&mdash;‘such a one,’
and ‘such an one;’ but in a case of this sort, we
had better adopt the more harmonious form; good
taste and a delicate ear will direct us to ‘such a
one,’ rather than ‘such <em>an</em> one.’</p>

<p>It has been remarked that there is a strong tendency
in English to get rid of inflections. Many
of these were found in old English which have
now fallen off. The old infinitive-ending <em>en</em> is
now altogether gone, though some adjectives in
<em>en</em> still remain; viz. those which denote material,
such as ‘golden,’ ‘earthen,’ ‘oaten,’ &amp;c. We had
at one time ‘rosen,’ ‘silvern,’ ‘tinnen,’ ‘boxen,’
and many others. These are now gone; and there
seems to be a prevalent disposition to cut off the
endings of those which remain. Instead of ‘a
golden watch,’ we now say ‘a gold watch,’ using
the noun for the adjective. In the same way, we
have ‘earthworks’ for ‘earthen works;’ though
we still keep ‘earthenware.’ Many of these adjectives
in <em>en</em> still hold their ground, though most
of those which are retained have lost a part of
their sense. ‘Brazen’ has now only a secondary
meaning; and stands for ‘bold’ or ‘impudent.’
In a concrete sense, the noun is used instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the adjective. We say a ‘brazen face,’ for an
‘impudent face;’ but ‘a brass knob,’ or ‘a brass
candlestick.’ Again: we have ‘a golden rule,’ in
a secondary; but a ‘gold’ ring in a primary
sense.</p>

<p>The word ‘pigmy’&mdash;derived from the Greek
πυγμὴ, the fist&mdash;was first spelled ‘p<em>y</em>gmy.’ It
meant one whose stature was no higher than from
the elbow to the fist. The change from <em>y</em> to <em>i</em>
was probably caused by the dislike of the printers
to <em>y</em> in the middle of a word. But it has here as
good a right to its place as the <em>y</em> in ‘h<em>y</em>mn,’
or ‘t<em>y</em>pe.’ It is, however, gone; and we must
submit.</p>

<p>Hundreds of words might be cited which have
been brought into their present forms by the influence
of corruption. The now generally received
explanation of ‘Rotten Row’ is, that it is a corruption
of ‘Route du Roi,’ originally the private road
used by King William III. when going from Piccadilly
to Kensington. The old form ‘diamant’ was
preferable to the more modern ‘diamond,’ because it
told its story more clearly. It was an inversion
of ‘adamant,’ the untameable, or invincible, so
called because it is the hardest of stones, and
cannot be cut except by one of its own species.</p>

<p>The modern spelling of the word ‘height’ is
a corruption. We have ‘wid<em>th</em>,’ from ‘wide;’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
‘leng<em>th</em>,’ from ‘long;’ and ‘bread<em>th</em>,’ from ‘broad.’
Why, then, not ‘highth,’ from ‘high?’ In the
writings of the seventeenth century we meet with
various spellings of this word. It is found ‘highth’
in the first edition of ‘Paradise Lost;’ and also
‘heigth’ and ‘heygth.’ Now the inversion of <em>ht</em>
for <em>th</em> has corrupted it into ‘heig<em>ht</em>;’ and so, for
the present, it will probably remain. The <em>d</em> in
‘admiral’ appears to be a corruption. All our
dictionaries give the derivation of this word from
the Arabic ‘amir,’ or ‘emir,’ a lord, or commander.
Neither the French ‘amiral,’ nor the
Italian ‘ammiraglio,’ has the <em>d</em>. Milton writes
the word ‘ammiral:’</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse10">the tallest pine</p>
<p class="verse">Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast</p>
<p class="verse">Of some great <em>ammiral</em>,&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">though in this passage, the word means a ship,
and not its commander. Mr. Wedgewood says
that, in many cases in Arabic, the article is placed
after the noun; and that the <em>ad</em> initial is a
mere corruption of the first syllable of ‘amir’ or
‘emir.’</p>

<p>It was a fanciful etymology which gave us the
word ‘Tartar.’ The incorrect spelling ‘Tartars’
for ‘Tatars’ occurs at the same time with the
appearance of the Mongols in Europe, in the
thirteenth century; and was probably introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
by the superstitious monks and writers who,
struck with the seeming analogy between ‘Tatar’
and Tartarus (the hell of the ancients), believed
that these ferocious invaders had come from the
infernal regions.</p>

<p>We are told by some writers that there are
between 2,000 and 3,000 words in the English
language, for which there is no recognised standard
of spelling. Though this number is probably
exaggerated, there are, no doubt, many in this
condition; and it naturally becomes a question
which of two forms is to be preferred. Here, we
should be at least consistent; we should hold to
the one, and altogether reject the other.</p>

<p>The two forms, ‘chemist’ and ‘chymist’ arose
from the word having a disputed derivation; but
the first is now received as correct. Of course, its
derivatives will therefore be spelled ‘chemical,’
‘chemistry,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>There was, at one time, a confusion between
‘choir’ and ‘quire.’ The second word has no
connection, except in sound, with the first, which
is from the Latin ‘chorus,’ through the French
‘chœur.’ As ‘quire,’ in the sense of a number
singing together, is now obsolete, so is ‘quirister,’
which must be spelled ‘chorister.’</p>

<p>There are two forms&mdash;‘coit,’ and ‘quoit.’ The
derivation of this word is somewhat obscure; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
if, as some suggest, it is connected with <em>cut</em>, the
form ‘coit’ is preferable to the other. Another
argument in favour of this form is that the word
is always pronounced as if beginning with a <em>c</em>
hard, or <em>k</em>; and not as if with <em>qu</em>.</p>

<p>There has been a rather sharp controversy
lately concerning the two forms ‘diocess’ and
‘diocese.’ The ‘Times’ adopts ‘diocess.’ Dr.
Latham says under the word, ‘diocese, frequently
but improperly, diocess.’ Webster says, ‘the
orthography of “diocess” is opposed to the derivation,
and is against the best English usage.’
There is little doubt that ‘diocess’ is the older,
and ‘diocese’ the newer form of the word: and
there is also little doubt, in spite of the ‘Times,’
that ‘diocese’ is the proper form.</p>

<p>Between ‘intire’ and ‘entire’ there is still a
divided practice. The word is a contraction of
the Latin ‘integer,’ which will account for the
initial <em>i</em>. But it comes to us directly from the
French ‘entier.’ So that ‘entire’ will probably
supplant ‘intire,’ though we still have ‘Barclay
and Co.’s <em>intire</em>.’</p>

<p>There are two forms of the word&mdash;‘referrible,’
and ‘referable.’ These are both in common use,
and both are given in the dictionaries; but the
second, ‘referable,’ is the proper form. There
was no Latin adjective ‘referibilis.’ Our word is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
a later formation, where <em>a</em> in such cases is always
used rather than <em>i</em>; and, therefore, it is better
spelled ‘referable.’ Besides, this form is in analogy
with ‘preferable,’ ‘inferable,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>Some still write ‘sirname’ incorrectly for ‘surname,’
probably from an idea that the word means
sire-name, or a name received from a sire (father).
But its real meaning is an added name; one name
added <em>to</em> another. It is from the French ‘surnom,’
and should be always spelled ‘surname.’</p>

<p>Between a ‘serjeant’-at-law, and a military
‘sergeant’ there is this difference: that the first
must be written with a <em>j</em>, and the second with a <em>g</em>.
The word is derived from the Latin ‘serviens,’ and
means, in both cases, one who serves; but the
words are spelled somewhat differently, to make a
distinction in their application.</p>

<p>A difference should be made between ‘story’
and ‘storey.’ The first means an account of facts,
and is a contraction of ‘history.’ It is a history
on a small scale. But ‘storey’ is a contraction of
‘stagery,’ and means the landing in a house; as
in ‘first storey,’ ‘second storey,’ &amp;c. Of course,
the plural form of the first word should be ‘stories,’
and of the second, ‘storeys.’</p>

<span class="fs40">MISCELLANEOUS DERIVATIONS OF WORDS.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent"><em>Abominable.</em> This word is from the Latin
verb ‘abominor,’ which again is from <em>ab</em> and
<em>omen</em>. The word involves the idea of what is
in a religious sense profane and detestable; in
fine, of evil omen. Milton always uses it in reference
to devilish, profane or idolatrous objects. It
was once thought that the true etymology of
‘abominable’ was from <em>ab</em> (from), and <em>homo</em> (a
man); and that its proper meaning was <em>repugnant
to human nature</em>. This, though not the right
derivation, may account for the word being still
often used in that sense.</p>

<p><em>Absurd</em>, which has the sense of ‘foolish,’ ‘inconsistent,’
&amp;c., is from the Latin ‘absurdus,’
compounded of ‘ab’ (from), and ‘surdus’ (deaf).
An ‘absurd’ answer is one you would probably
get ‘from a deaf’ man; i.e. one wholly irrelevant
to the question.</p>

<p><em>Academy.</em> This word owes its origin to the name
of a grove near Athens, ἀκαδημία, where Plato and
other philosophers used to give lectures to their
followers. Hence this name has been frequently
given to institutions for instruction.</p>

<p><em>Ajar.</em> The Anglo-Saxon ‘cerre’ is a turn; from
‘cerran,’ to turn; hence a door is said to be ‘ajar,’
when it is on the turn. From the same root we
have to <em>churn</em> milk; i.e. to <em>turn</em> it about. Also a
<em>char</em>-woman&mdash;one who does a ‘turn’ of work.
Compare the German ‘kehren.’</p>

<p><em>Archipelago.</em> This name was given by the
modern Greeks to the Ægean Sea. It is a corruption
of ἁγιὸς πέλαγος (Hagios pelagos), ‘Holy
Sea.’</p>

<p><em>Ban</em>, to proclaim or denounce. The original
meaning is connected with ‘<em>ban</em>ner,’ a flag,
or standard; in feudal times, the rallying point
to which retainers flocked to do battle for their
seigneur. The word is supposed to be connected
with ‘bend,’ in the sense of to make a sign.
‘Bandit,’ a proclaimed outlaw, is from the same
source, as also ‘Banns,’ i.e. a proclamation of
marriage.</p>

<p><em>Bankrupt.</em> The following circumstances gave
rise to this word. It was the custom in the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries for the Lombard merchants
to expose their wares for sale in the market-place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
on <em>benches</em>. Whenever any one of their number
failed in his business, or could not pay his debts,
all the other merchants set upon him, drove him
from the market, and <em>broke</em> his <em>bench</em> to pieces.
‘<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Banco rotto</span>’ is the Italian for bench-broken.
Hence came the word, which passed into French
in the form ‘<em>banqueroute</em>;’ and into English as
‘<em>bankrupt</em>.’</p>

<p><em>Barley-sugar.</em> Has nothing whatever to do
with the grain ‘<em>barley</em>.’ The first part of the
word is here an inversion&mdash;and at the same time
a corruption of the French brûlé (burnt). The
whole word was originally ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sucre brûlé</span>’ (burnt
sugar), and it is still sometimes called ‘sugar-barley.’</p>

<p><em>Birmingham.</em> The name of an Anglo-Saxon
family was often formed by adding <em>ing</em> to that of
its founder; <em>ing</em> meaning ‘son of,’ or ‘descended
from.’ The estate or residence was called the
‘<em>ham</em>,’ or home; and the name was formed by
adding this syllable <em>ham</em>, to the family name.
Thus, the family of a Saxon leader named ‘Beorm’
possessed a residence in Mercia, to which they
gave the name of ‘Beorm-ing-ham,’ or the home
of the sons of Beorm; now corrupted into ‘Birmingham.’
Many places in England still retain
the names originally given them by Anglo-Saxon
families; as ‘Nottingham,’ ‘Walsingham,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Blackguard</em> was a name first given to the
lowest menials engaged in the dirty work of a
kitchen or household, as scullion, link-boy, coal-carrier,
&amp;c. It was afterwards applied to any
loose, idle vagabonds.</p>

<p><em>Book.</em> In the same way as the Latin <em>liber</em>
(the bark of a tree), was afterwards used in the
sense of a book, because it was a material used
for writing on; so our word <em>book</em> comes from the
Saxon ‘boc’ (a beech tree). In a rude, uncivilised
age, it was the custom to form alphabetical letters
with the pliable twigs of the beech. To this day,
the German for ‘to spell’ is ‘buchstabiren’ (from
‘Buch’ (beech), and ‘stab’ (a staff or twig)); i.e.
to put the beech-staves properly together.</p>

<p><em>Booty.</em> The Anglo-Saxon ‘bet’ meant ‘better’;
and ‘betan’ was to amend or make better. Thus
a ‘booty’ would be that which betters us; ‘bootless’
is ‘without effect or improvement,’ and ‘so
much to boot,’ is so much to our advantage.</p>

<p><em>Burglar.</em> This is from the Low Latin ‘burgilatro,’
a house-robber; one who breaks into a
house with a felonious intent. The old French
‘lerre’ is a contraction of the Latin ‘latro,’ a
robber.</p>

<p><em>Cabal.</em> The usually received etymology of this
word is that it is formed of the initials of the
names of the five ministers of Charles II. who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
succeeded to the government of this country after
the banishment of Lord Clarendon&mdash;<em>C</em>lifford, <em>A</em>shley,
<em>B</em>uckingham, <em>A</em>rlington, and <em>L</em>auderdale.
But Mr. Wedgewood suggests that it comes from
‘Cabala,’ or the mysterious tradition delivered to
Moses with the Law, on Mount Sinai, and handed
down by the Jews from father to son. ‘Hence,’
he says, ‘Cabal came to signify a secret machination
or plotting.’ Lord Macaulay favours the
first explanation.</p>

<p><em>Caitiff.</em> This English word presents us with
a curious lesson. It is, in fact, only another form
of ‘captive,’ though it has come to signify a wretch
capable of perpetrating the darkest crimes. The
Latin ‘captivus,’ a prisoner, is the source of the
modern Italian ‘cattivo,’ which has the general
sense of ‘bad;’ and the French ‘chétif,’ which
signifies ‘mean,’ ‘pitiful,’ or ‘insignificant,’ is
another form of the same word. All these varieties
point to the same conclusion, viz. the moral
degradation naturally produced in the human
mind by captivity.</p>

<p><em>Candidate.</em> In ancient Rome it was the custom
for those who sued for offices of state, to be
dressed in white robes. Hence came the word
‘candidate,’ which is derived from the Latin ‘candidus’
(white); and which signifies literally&mdash;‘dressed
in white.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Carat</em> is from the Arabic ‘kaura,’ a bean,
which varies very little in weight. It was introduced
into India as a standard weight for diamonds.
The Arabic words are <em>goort</em>, <em>girat</em>, and <em>gurat</em>; corrupted
into ‘<em>carat</em>.’</p>

<p><em>Cardinal.</em> Certain dignitaries of the Church
of Rome are called ‘cardinals.’ This word is
derived from the Latin ‘cardo,’ a hinge. One of
the favourite comparisons by which the Church of
Rome sought to set herself up above all the other
churches of Christendom, was that it was the
<em>hinge</em> upon which all the rest of the church, as
the door, turned, or depended. Hence the higher
clergy were called cardinals, as being closely connected
with the Pope, who was the ‘<em>cardo</em>,’ or
hinge of them all. Certain virtues are also called
‘cardinal,’ as being those upon which all other
virtues turn.</p>

<p><em>Caricature.</em> This is literally an overloaded
or over-charged representation. It is derived
from the Italian ‘<em>caricare</em>,’ to load. In a caricature,
a resemblance is retained; but the details
are exaggerated.</p>

<p><em>Carnival</em> is from the Latin ‘caro’ (flesh),
and ‘vale’ (farewell). It signifies literally ‘farewell
to flesh;’ and is applied to the holiday held
in Roman Catholic countries the week before Lent.
It may be considered as a feast before a fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Caudle.</em> The derivation of this word is yet
undecided. Latham gives it as a corruption of
‘cordial;’ while Wedgewood derives it from the
French ‘chaudeau’ (from <em>chaud</em>, hot), a warm
comforting drink for the sick.</p>

<p><em>Chancel.</em> This means the part of a church
enclosed or railed off from the body of the building
by lattice-work (Latin, <em>cancelli</em>). Chancellors
were originally law officers who stood at the railings
(ad cancellos) in a court of justice, and received
the petitions of the suitors. The verb ‘to
cancel’ is from the same source. To ‘cancel’ a
name is to efface it by drawing a pen across it in
diagonal lines, so as to make lattice-work over it.</p>

<p><em>Cheat.</em> From the Latin verb ‘cadĕre,’ to fall,
came the old French ‘eschoir,’ and hence ‘escheats.’
This is a law-term signifying lands
which <em>fall</em> to the lord by forfeiture, or by the
death of a tenant. The king’s ‘escheators’ were
officers appointed to look after the king’s ‘escheats;’
and as they had many opportunities of
practising fraud, and were much complained of on
that score, the term escheator (or cheater) came
to signify any fraudulent person. This is the
origin of the present meaning of the verb ‘to
cheat.’</p>

<p><em>Church.</em> This word, though consisting of only
one syllable, has in it the elements of two roots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
It is of Greek origin, and signifies literally ‘the
Lord’s House.’ Κύριος (Kyrios) is the Greek
for ‘Lord;’ and οἶκος (oikos) means, in that language,
‘house,’ or ‘dwelling.’ Putting these two
roots together we get ‘<em>Kyri-oik</em>.’ This, by a
natural law would contract into ‘kyrik.’ In
Scotch we find ‘kirk,’ and in German ‘Kirche.’
In English the guttural is softened, and the word
appears as ‘<em>church</em>.’</p>

<p><em>Comedy.</em> This is derived, according to Aristotle,
from κώμη (komē), a village; and ᾠδὴ (odē),
a song. It was at first a song of joy of the villagers
at the gathering in of the harvest&mdash;a sort
of harvest-home. This was a lighter and gayer
song, and did not partake of the more solemn, and
at first, religious tone of the tragedy. Others
derive comedy from κῶμος, and ᾠδή, ‘a song of
revellers.’</p>

<p><em>Companion.</em> Two derivations are given of
this word. 1. From the French ‘campagne,’
which is from the Latin ‘cum,’ and ‘pagus,’ a
village, or district. By this explanation it would
mean one of those who belonged to the same district.
2. From the Low Latin ‘companium,’ an
association; formed from ‘cum’ (with), and
‘panis’ (bread). This conveys the meaning of
bread-sharer. Mr. Wedgewood favours the second
explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Comrade.</em> There is no doubt that this word,
which is in French ‘camarade,’ is derived from
the Italian ‘camera,’ afterwards in French ‘chambre,’
and that it was first applied to those who
lived together in the same room (chambre).</p>

<p><em>Cordwainer.</em> During the Moorish government
of southern Spain, the city of Cordŏva became
celebrated for the manufacture of leather.
Hence, the French ‘cordovan’ meant originally
the leather of Cordova. Hence, also, the English
‘cordwainer,’ and the French ‘cordovanier’ (now
contracted into ‘cordonnier,’) a worker in leather.</p>

<p><em>Counterpane.</em> The middle-age Latin ‘culcita’
meant a mattrass. This in French was ‘coulte,’
and in English became ‘quilt.’ ‘Culcita puncta’
meant a quilt punctured with stitches, so as to
form a pattern. This, in French, became ‘coulte-pointe;’
afterwards converted into ‘conte-pointe,’
and ‘contre-pointe.’ Hence at length came the
English ‘counter-pane.’</p>

<p><em>Country Dance.</em> Some think that this really
means a dance of country people. But the probable
derivation is the French <em>contre</em>, ‘over against,’
or ‘opposite to,’ which has been corrupted into
‘country;’ and the whole word means a dance in
which the partners stand opposite to (contre) each
other.</p>

<p><em>Curmudgeon.</em> It was suggested by Menage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
that this word is from the French ‘cœur,’ and
‘méchant,’ wicked heart. But the more probable
derivation is from ‘corn-mudgin.’ Corn-mudgins
were dealers in corn, who were unpopular, as
it was thought that they hoarded, and kept up
the price of corn, to serve their own interests.
Hence the word came to signify an avaricious
monopolist.</p>

<p><em>Delirious</em> comes from the Latin compound ‘de’
(from), and ‘lira’ (a furrow, or ridge). The
word is a metaphor, taken from those who deviate
from the straight line, or furrow, in ploughing.
It is now applied to those who rove in mind, or
are disordered in intellect.</p>

<p><em>Ecstasy.</em> This word has the meaning of violent
excitement. It is now generally used in
the sense of some pleasurable feeling, though it
was formerly much more extended in signification.
It is derived from the Greek ἐκ (out), and στάσις
(a standing); i.e. literally ‘a standing out.’ It is
curious that in the Saxon part of our language,
there is a corresponding phrase which exactly explains
this word; viz. ‘<em>to be beside oneself</em>.’ We
commonly say, ‘He was beside himself with joy.’
In a state of ‘ecstasy,’ the soul may be said to leap
out, as it were, and stand forth from the body.</p>

<p><em>Fanatic</em> is from the Latin ‘fanum,’ a temple.
This adjective was at first applied to people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
affected by a strong religious feeling&mdash;possessed
by an incontrollable enthusiasm.</p>

<p><em>Favour.</em> Ladies in their most brilliant attire
were generally spectators of the tournaments of
the Middle Ages. They were, severally, interested
in the knights, and encouraged them, by
looks, tokens, or gestures, to do their duty manfully.
They frequently threw them a portion of
their dress, such as a sleeve, mantle, or bow
of ribbons, called a <em>favour</em>, which the knight
wore on his armour, and forfeited if he was vanquished.
From this custom has descended, to our
days, the fashion of distributing bows of ribbon,
still called <em>favours</em>, to the guests and attendants at
a wedding.</p>

<p><em>Faubourg.</em> This is considered by French philologists,
to be a corruption of ‘<em>forsbourg</em>.’ The
old French ‘fors’ (now <em>hors</em>), is from the Latin
‘foras,’ ‘outside,’ or ‘abroad.’ Faubourg (the
present orthography) would naturally lead to
the idea that it meant ‘false town,’ or ‘unreal
town:’ whereas it means and literally corresponds
with the English ‘suburb,’ i.e. a district or place
situated ‘foras burgi,’ outside the town.</p>

<p><em>Feud.</em> According to M. Guizot, the word ‘feodum’
appears for the first time in a charter of
Charles Le Gros, 884. The etymology is uncertain;
but two suggestions have been made, either of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
which is probable. Some think the word is connected
with the Latin ‘fides,’ faith, and means
‘land given,’ for which the holder was bound in
<em>fidelity</em> to his suzerain lord. According to others,
‘feod’ is of Germanic origin; and is derived from
‘fe’ (or fee)&mdash;still used in English in the sense
of a recompense&mdash;and ‘od’ an old Germanic root
now obsolete, meaning ‘goods,’ or ‘property.’
Thus, ‘feod’ would mean reward-land. M. Guizot
favours the second explanation.</p>

<p><em>Foolscap.</em> By a statute of Queen Anne certain
duties were imposed on all paper imported
from abroad. Among the various sorts of paper
herein mentioned is the Genoa ‘foolscap.’ This
word is a corruption of the Italian ‘<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">foglio capo,</span>’ a
chief, or full-sized, sheet of paper. Foglio (leaf),
is from the Latin ‘folium,’ which appears in French
as ‘feuille.’</p>

<p><em>Garment</em> is a contraction of the French ‘garnement,’
from the verb ‘garnir,’ to decorate or
garnish. It is now restricted to the meaning of
‘garnishing’ or decorating the body by dress.</p>

<p><em>Gew-gaw.</em> The derivation of this word still remains
doubtful, though many suggestions have
been made of its origin. May it not be from the
French ‘jou-jou,’ a plaything?</p>

<p><em>Gooseberry.</em> Dr. Johnson, whose etymologies
are not always to be depended on, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
those of Saxon words, explains the word ‘gooseberry’&mdash;‘a
fruit eaten as a sauce for goose.’ But
it is, in truth, a corruption of the German ‘krausbeere,’
or ‘krautelbeere,’ from ‘kraus’ or ‘gorse,’
‘crisp;’ and the fruit is so called from the upright
hairs with which it is covered. So that ‘gooseberry,’
is really, a corruption of ‘gorseberry.’ But
what is gooseberry <em>fool</em>? ‘Fool’ is here also a
corruption&mdash;it is from the French ‘foulé,’ ‘mashed’
or ‘crushed,’ and the whole word means ‘crushed
gooseberries.’</p>

<p><em>Gossip.</em> ‘Sib’ was an Anglo-Saxon word,
meaning ‘relation,’ and the term ‘gossip’ was
first applied to the relation between godfathers
and godmothers in baptism, so that a gossip (or
God-sib), meant a relation in God (i.e. in a religious
sense). It has now passed into the sense
of a great chatterer or talker; but the above explanation
accounts for its origin.</p>

<p><em>Hammercloth.</em> In the olden time, before there
was any hotel accommodation in England for
travellers, it was the custom with those going on
a journey to fill a ‘hanaper’ (or hamper) with
provisions, and throw a cloth over it, to conceal
its somewhat homely appearance. This was
placed in front of the carriage, and served as a
seat for the driver. Thus, from ‘hanaper-cloth,’
came ‘hammer-cloth.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Harbour.</em> The two roots of this compound word
are the Anglo-Saxon ‘here,’ an army; and ‘beorgan,’
to protect. A harbour is then, literally, a
place to protect an army.</p>

<p><em>Heir-loom.</em> From the Saxon ‘geloma,’ tools,
utensils, or pieces of furniture. These in law are
called personal chattels, and when they descended
in inheritance from father to son, they were called
‘heir-looms.’</p>

<p><em>Homage</em> is derived from the French ‘homme,’
a man. The ceremony of ‘homage’ was, in the
Middle Ages, a solemn declaration of the vassal
that he would be the man (homme) of his future
lord. He knelt down; placed both his hands
between those of his lord; with his head bare,
and without his arms; and then swore that he
would use his hands and his weapons, when they
should be restored to him, in his future lord’s
service.</p>

<p><em>Hurry.</em> ‘Here’ was the Anglo-Saxon for an
army (compare the German ‘Heer’); and ‘herian’
was to act as an army, viz. to ravage, despoil,
and plunder a country. Hence come the English
words ‘hurry,’ ‘harry,’ and ‘harrow.’</p>

<p><em>Hustings</em> is from the Saxon ‘Hus’ (a house)
and ‘Ting’ (a council). This was the name given
to the municipal court of the City of London,
where probably the elections were originally conducted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Now, the word signifies the booths where
speeches are made at an election.</p>

<p><em>Jeopardy.</em> This is from the Middle-Age Latin;
‘jocus partitus’ (French, ‘jeu-parti’), i.e. a divided
game, where the chances are even&mdash;a choice of
alternatives.</p>

<p><em>Kickshaws</em> is a corruption of the French ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quelque
chose;</span>’ <em>something</em> so disguised by cooking as
scarcely to be recognised.</p>

<p><em>Late</em> is from the Anglo-Saxon ‘lætan;’ to let,
or allow. ‘Lazy’ is from the same root, as is also
‘loiter.’ He who ‘loiters’ must be ‘late.’</p>

<p><em>Lout.</em> This comes from the Anglo-Saxon verb
‘lutian,’ to bow. It was originally applied to a
cringing menial, who was continually <em>bowing</em> before
his master; and as in this case, the act was probably
performed in a clownish, ungraceful way,
the word thus came to signify an awkward, clumsy
fellow.</p>

<p><em>Menial.</em> This adjective is derived from the
old French noun ‘mesnie’ (or meny), which, in
the Middle Ages, meant the servants or household
of some noble or chieftain taken collectively. A
<em>menial</em> occupation was, originally, one performed
by some member of the ‘mesnie.’ It is from this
last that the English expression ‘a many’ is derived.
It was at first ‘a mesnie,’ or a collective
number of servants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Meringue.</em> Shakspere says that ‘great events
from trivial causes spring.’ But we may sometimes
reverse this saying, and say with equal
truth, that trivial effects spring from great causes.
It may appear strange that the French could not
hit upon a more dignified way of commemorating
a victory than by giving its name to a then newly
invented cake, but such is the fact. The battle of
Marengo produced the ‘Meringue’!!</p>

<p><em>Miscreant</em>, which is from the French mécreant
(or mécroyant), was first used in the times of
the Crusades, and then signified simply an unbeliever.
But disbelief in Christianity being at
that time regarded as the worst of crimes, the
word soon passed into the more general sense of a
wicked wretch.</p>

<p><em>Mouchard.</em>&mdash;In the latter part of the sixteenth
century, when the French Government was on
the look-out for heretics, a certain Antoine <em>Mouchy</em>,
a doctor of the Sorbonne and canon of Noyon,
made himself notorious by his zeal against the
Reformers. The secret spies he employed in
detecting the heretics were called, from his name,
<em>Mouchards</em>, a word which now signifies the basest
and meanest of betrayers.</p>

<p><em>Mountebank.</em>&mdash;This means a quack medicine
vendor, so called from the Italian ‘montare’ (to
mount) and ‘banco’ (a bench). Literally, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
who mounts a bench, to boast of his infallible skill
in curing diseases.</p>

<p><em>Naught.</em> ‘Aught’ is a contraction of the Saxon
‘a wiht’ (or, a whit), any creature or thing.
‘Naught’ is the negative of ‘aught,’ and means
‘not a whit.’ The adjective ‘naughty’ is now
confined in its application to the behaviour of
children; but it was once much more extensively
used.</p>

<p><em>Palace.</em> This term, which is now used in a
general sense for a king’s residence, was first
applied to a dwelling of the Roman Emperor
Nero. One of the seven hills of Rome was called
‘Palatinus,’ from Pales, a pastoral deity whose
festival was there celebrated on April 21 as the
birthday of Rome. Under Nero, all the private
houses on the ‘collis Palatinus’ were pulled down
to make room for the Emperor’s new residence.
This house was called ‘Palatium,’ and it afterwards
became the type of all the palaces of the
kings and emperors of Europe.</p>

<p><em>Palfrey.</em>&mdash;This is a contraction of the French
‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par le frein</span>’ (by the bridle). It is a horse used
on state occasions, and distinguished from the
war horse&mdash;a horse led by the bridle, ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mené par
le frein</i>.’</p>

<p><em>Pamphlet.</em>&mdash;It is supposed that this word is
a contraction of the French ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par un filet.</span>’ It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
means a small book, not bound, but held together
by a thread&mdash;‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tenu par un filet</i>.’</p>

<p><em>Pavilion</em> is derived directly from the French
‘pavillon,’ where it is used in the sense of a tent
or flag. But the origin of the word is the Latin
‘papilio,’ a butterfly. Tents or flags would be
so called, because of their flapping about as a
butterfly.</p>

<p><em>Person.</em> This word was originally a theatrical
term, and properly meant an actor. The
theatres of the ancient Romans were built so large
as to contain between 30,000 and 40,000 people.
Now it was impossible for the actors to make
themselves heard through so large a space; and
they therefore wore masks, inside of which, close
to the aperture for the mouth, was a certain mechanical
contrivance, which made the voice more
sonorous, so that the actors’ words could be heard
in all parts of the theatre. The Latin for a mask
is ‘persona,’ so called because the voice <em>sounded
through it</em>. <em>Per</em> is in Latin, ‘through;’ and <em>son</em> is
the root of the verb ‘sonare’ to sound. By a
common figure of speech, the word meaning
‘mask’ (persona) was afterwards applied to its
wearer; and thus ‘persona’ came to signify
‘actor.’ This was its original, theatrical meaning.
But, as all human beings are, in one sense, actors&mdash;as
they all have a part to play on the stage of life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the word ‘person’ was afterwards used in a general
sense to signify any one man or woman. In one
special case, it appears in the form ‘parson,’ to
designate the ‘chief person,’ or priest, of a parish.
In this sense, however, the word is now falling
into disuse.</p>

<p><em>Pet.</em> The French adjective ‘petit’ (small) is
derived from the Latin participle, ‘petitus,’ sought
after. From this root came the English word
‘pet.’ ‘My pet’ means literally, ‘my sought
after or desired one.’ ‘Petty’ is also from the
French ‘petit;’ but it has degenerated: and is
now always used in a bad sense, as in a ‘petty
action.’</p>

<p><em>Pert</em> is nothing else than the old French ‘aperte,’
(from the Latin apertus) open, public, without
concealment. The sense has now degenerated
into ‘saucy’ or ‘impudent.’ ‘Malapert’ had that
meaning from the beginning; but this word is
now seldom used. ‘Pert’ seems to have taken
its place.</p>

<p><em>Poltroon.</em> The derivation of this word is still
undecided; but the following account of it has
been offered. In the later ages of the Roman
empire, the ancient valour of the citizens had so
degenerated that, rather than fight, many actually
cut off their right thumbs, in order to disable
themselves from using the pike. The Latin for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
‘thumb’ is ‘pollex’; and ‘truncus’ means, in that
language, ‘maimed’ or ‘mutilated.’ These two
roots put together give us ‘pol-troon’ from ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>pol</em>lice
<em>trun</em>cus,</span>’ i.e. with the thumb cut off. As this
was done with a cowardly motive, the word very
naturally came to signify a coward, a meaning
which it retains to this day.</p>

<p><em>Pontiff</em> (Lat. pontifex). There are various
etymologies of this word. Varro derives it from
‘pons,’ a bridge, and ‘facĕre,’ to make or build.
He says that the pontiffs had built the ‘pons
sublicius’ (over the Tiber); and afterwards restored
it, that sacrifices might be performed on
each side of the river. It is now used only as a
title of the Pope of Rome.</p>

<p><em>Porpoise.</em> This word is from the French porc
(hog) and poisson (fish); so called from its resemblance
to a hog. Spenser spells the word
‘porcpisces.’ It is singular that, in this case, the
French should have adopted the Teutonic word
‘marsouin’ (mereswine); while in English it is
known by its French name&mdash;‘porc-poisson.’</p>

<p><em>Post.</em> The apparently contradictory meanings
of this word may give it a peculiar interest.
In its original sense, it means something <em>placed</em>;
from the Latin participle ‘positum’; as, for example,
a pillar fixed in the street. But we also
hear of <em>post</em> haste, <em>post</em> horses, &amp;c., and, in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
cases, the meaning seems directly opposed to the
etymology. When letters, parcels, &amp;c. were first
transmitted from place to place, stations (or posts)
were placed at intervals from each other, and
letters were rapidly passed on by messengers from
one station to the next, and so on, across the
whole country. This was called <em>post</em> haste; i.e.
in such haste as was used when letters were sent
in the above-described way.</p>

<p><em>Punch.</em> The well-known beverage called punch
is said to be derived from the Hindostani panch&mdash;five.
It means a mixture of five ingredients:
1. spirit, 2. water, 3. sugar, 4. acid, and 5. essential
oil of lemon.</p>

<p><em>Puny.</em> This is an English form of the French
puis-né, or (de)puis-né (Latin, post natus), born
since. It is in contradistinction to the French
aîné (ante-natus) elder or born before; and now
signifies weak, ill-conditioned in growth. A
junior judge is still, in legal phrase, a puisne judge.</p>

<p><em>Quack.</em> The whole word is in German ‘qualksalber,’
of which ‘quack’ is a contraction. ‘To
quack’ is to talk boastfully&mdash;to make a great
fuss; and ‘salber’ is from <em>salve</em>, something to
<em>heal</em>; so that quacksalber may be explained, one
who talks noisily and fussily about his healing
medicines.</p>

<p><em>Quandary.</em> This is a corruption of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qu’en dirai-(je)?</span>’ ‘what shall I say of it?’
It expresses that condition of doubt or uncertainty
in which such a question would be naturally
asked.</p>

<p><em>Ragoût.</em> This French noun, which may be
now considered as naturalised in English, is a
contraction of the Italian ‘<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">miro gusto,</span>’ ‘wonderful
taste.’</p>

<p><em>Raiment</em> is derived from ‘to array,’ and is a
contraction for ‘arrayment.’</p>

<p><em>Ransack.</em> This word is founded in Swedish,
‘ransacka,’ where it means to search a house for
stolen goods. It is compounded of the O.N.
‘rann,’ a house, and Sw. ‘soka,’ to seek.</p>

<p><em>Religion</em> is from the Latin ‘<em>re</em>’ (back), and
‘<em>ligare</em>,’ ‘to bind;’ literally, that which binds
back, or restrains us from the commission of sin.</p>

<p><em>Right</em> and <em>Wrong</em>. The first of these words,
in a secondary sense, has a meaning analogous to
proceeding in a straight line, the Latin ‘rectus,’
from which it is derived, having that meaning.
The French ‘droit’ is from ‘directus.’ Our word
‘wrong’ is only another form of ‘wrung,’ i. e.
‘<em>twisted</em>’ (out of the right line). It may be observed,
by the way, that the French ‘tort’
(wrong) is from the Latin ‘tortus,’ twisted; so
that the same principle operates in both cases.</p>

<p><em>Romance.</em> A name given to certain European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
languages (especially the Provençal), which grew
out of the old Roman or Latin, The Troubadours,
or poets, who wrote in the Provençal
language being notorious for their exaggerated
sentiment, the word has come to mean a wildly
imaginative fiction; and it is even sometimes
used as a softened expression for a falsehood.</p>

<p><em>Salary.</em> This is from the Latin ‘salarium.’
According to Pliny, it is derived from ‘sal’ (salt),
that being the most necessary article for the
maintenance of life. In the reign of the Emperor
Augustus it comprised the provisions as well as
the pay of the Roman military officers. From
‘salary’ probably came the expression, ‘he is not
worth his <em>salt</em>,’ i.e. his pay, or wages.</p>

<p><em>Sarcasm.</em>&mdash;The root of this word is the Greek
σάρξ (sarx) flesh, from which comes σαρκάζω
(sarcazo) ‘I tear flesh.’ The derivation throws
a strong light on its true meaning&mdash;a tearing
of the flesh. But it is now used only in a secondary
sense.</p>

<p><em>Saunter.</em> It is said that, in the time of the
Crusades, many foreign mendicants overran England.
They professed to be on their return from
a pilgrimage to the ‘Sainte Terre:’ and the
popular voice gave these vagabonds the name of
‘saunterers.’</p>

<p><em>Sedition</em> is from the Latin ‘se’ (apart), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
‘itio,’ a going (from ‘eo’ I go). Sedition, then,
means ‘a going apart,’ i.e. a departure from submission
to the laws. It now implies a violent
opposition to government, and involves the idea
of commotion and disturbance of the peace.</p>

<p><em>Seneschal.</em> This is a compound of the Latin
‘senex’ (old) and the Gothic ‘scalco’ (a servant).
The seneschal of a castle was, in the Middle Ages,
an <em>aged servant</em>, whose duty it was to keep the
keys, take care of the house, and superintend the
feasts and domestic ceremonies. ‘Seneschal’
means ‘aged servant,’ as ‘marshal’ (‘<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">mara scalco</span>’)
means, literally, ‘horse servant.’</p>

<p><em>Sincere.</em> One suggestion concerning the etymology
of this word is, that it was compounded
from the Latin ‘sine’ (without), and ‘cerâ’ (wax)&mdash;‘without
wax.’ In this view, the term is referred
to a practice of the ancient sculptors, who,
when they found a flaw in the marble of which
they were forming a statue, filled up the place
with wax, in order to conceal the defect. Those
pieces of statuary that had no flaws were, consequently,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine cerâ</span>’ (without wax); and the word
‘sincere’ thus acquired its present meaning; viz.
perfect, whole, without flaw. Many etymologists,
however, reject this derivation, and the origin of
the word is still considered as doubtful.</p>

<p><em>Simple.</em> Whether ‘sincere’ be or be not from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine cerâ,</span>’ it is generally allowed that ‘simple’
is from the Latin ‘sine,’ and ‘plico,’ I fold; i.e.
literally, ‘without fold.’ The Latin ‘simplex,’
‘duplex,’ ‘triplex,’ &amp;c. are in English, ‘sim<em>ple</em>,’
‘dou<em>ble</em>,’ ‘tri<em>ple</em>,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p><em>Soldier.</em> This English word comes directly
from the French ‘soldat,’ which, again, is from the
Latin ‘solidus,’ Italian ‘soldo,’ and French ‘solde,’
‘sou’ (pay)&mdash;the name of a coin which a man received
as his pay for fighting. The word originally
meant one who performed military service,
not in fulfilment of the feudal obligation, but upon
contract, and for stipulated pay.</p>

<p><em>Somerset.</em> The corruption of a word often
obscures its derivation; as is the case here. This
is originally from the Italian ‘soprasalto,’ an over-leap.
The French corrupted the word into ‘sobresault,’
and the English to ‘somersault,’ and then
to ‘somerset.’ But it should be always spelled
‘somersault.’ It properly means a <em>leap</em> in which
the heels are thrown <em>over</em> the head.</p>

<p><em>Spouse.</em> The origin of this word may be traced
to the Greek verb σβέννυμι (sbennumi), ‘I pour
out;’ which passed into Latin as ‘spondeo’
(sponsus). The Latin verb came to signify ‘to
make a contract’ or promise. In making contracts,
it was a custom with the Romans <em>to pour
out</em> libations to the gods. Hence, any one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
contracted an engagement (especially in the case
of marriage) was called ‘sponsus,’ i.e. ‘engaged,’
or ‘betrothed.’ The modern Italians softened the
word into ‘sposo,’ and the French transformed it
into ‘époux.’ Then it passed into English in the
form of ‘spouse.’ Godfathers and godmothers are
called ‘sponsors,’ for the same reason; because
they engage, or bind themselves, in certain contingencies,
to instruct a child in his religious
duties.</p>

<p><em>Stalwart</em> is often written, in early English,
‘stal-ward.’ It is from the Anglo-Saxon ‘stal-weorth,’
i.e. worth stealing, or taking. The word
is now used in the sense of strong-limbed, noble,
manly in appearance.</p>

<p><em>Stationer.</em> The word ‘statio’ meant, in the
Middle Ages, ‘a stall,’ or ‘shop,’ and was at last
used for a shop where books and paper were sold.
Hence came ‘<em>stationarius</em>,’ one who held a station,
or who dealt in books, paper, &amp;c.</p>

<p><em>Tawdry.</em> According to the legend, St. Etheldreda
(Saint Audrey) is said to have died of
a quinsy, which she considered sent her as a
judgment for her vanity concerning necklaces in
her youth. Hence ‘tawdry’ has been explained
as the necklace of St. Audrey. The word now
qualifies any silly, frivolous ornamentation; fine
and showy, but without taste or elegance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Thing.</em> There is a close connection between
the noun ‘thing’ and the verb ‘to think.’ In
fact, the one is derived from the other. For what
is a <em>thing</em>? It is whatever causes us to <em>think</em>.
There is the same connection between the Latin
noun ‘res’ and the verb ‘reor.’ We may also observe
that the Italian ‘cosa’ and the French
‘chose’ are formed by the same analogy. They
both mean ‘cause,’ i. e. cause of ideas or thoughts.</p>

<p><em>Tragedy.</em> It was a custom with the Greek
peasants, when they gathered in the vintage, to
recite or sing an ode in honour of Bacchus, their
tutelary god of wine; and on this solemn occasion,
by way of propitiating that divinity, they
sacrificed to him a he-goat. The Greek for a ‘he-goat’
is τράγος; and a song (or ode) is, in that
language, ᾠδὴ (odē). Putting together τράγος and ᾠδὴ
we get ‘tragœdia’ (tragedy); literally, ‘the
song of the goat,’ or, the song sung when the goat
was sacrificed to Bacchus. Various additions
were afterwards made, such as dialogue, chorus,
&amp;c., till at length the drama appeared in its
present form.</p>

<p><em>Wiseacre.</em> This word has, really, no connection
whatever with ‘acre.’ The two roots, ‘wise’
and ‘acre,’ are clearly incompatible. How then,
did they come together? The word is, both in
spelling and pronunciation, a corruption of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
German ‘weissager,’ a ‘wise-<em>sayer</em>,’ or sayer of
wise maxims, or precepts.</p>

<p><em>Wont.</em> The Anglo-Saxon ‘wunian’ meant to
dwell, which naturally involved the idea of being
accustomed to; for we must become accustomed
to the dwelling in which we live. ‘He was
<em>wont</em> to say,’ means he was in the habit of saying.
Compare the German ‘wohnen’ and ‘Wohnung.’</p>

<p><em>Zero.</em> The name given to the arithmetical
‘0’ is said to be a contraction of the Italian
‘zephiro,’ a zephyr; i.e. a mere nothing; having
no more substance than a breeze, or breath of air.
It is also sometimes called a ‘cipher,’ from the
Arabic ‘cifr,’ empty.</p>

more simple than that of the majority
of English grammars published of late

Mr. <span class="smcap">Graham’s</span> book is the abundance of
its exercises; and these can be worked
out after each rule, so that the young

as thoroughly as its importance deserves.’</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Critic.</span></p>

<p>‘Not only are the rules here expressed
in very simple and intelligible
language, but each is immediately followed
by an exercise, in which the principle
on which the rule rests is illustrated
and enforced by repeated examples. This
is, we think, the only method of making
a clear impression upon a mind of average
capacity; and even where unusually good
abilities make its adoption not absolutely
necessary, it may be employed with considerable
advantage in stimulating the
pupil’s zeal by enabling him to feel at
every successful application of the principle
involved a very encouraging sense
of progress.... The most novel feature
in Mr. <span class="smcap">Graham’s</span> book is a treatise on
prosody, which, though a very necessary

they are not clearly understood. To be of
real utility, a grammatical rule should be
immediately followed by an exercise, in
which the principle is practically applied

has aimed at exciting an interest in the
youthful mind by the simplicity and clearness

<div class="textcol fs70">
<p>The object of this little work, which is
an improved <em>Spelling</em> and <em>Reading made
Easy</em> combined, is to give the child who has
mastered the alphabet distinct ideas on the
nature of words and the grammatical structure
of sentences; and it is intended to be
put into the pupil’s hands before he begins
the regular study of grammar. The principle
of the work is illustration by example
and by frequent repetition, with a view to
bring into action a child’s powers of discrimination
from his earliest conception of a
combination of spoken or written words to
convey an idea. In order to accomplish
this end, neither a rule nor an explanation
is given which is not immediately exemplified
in an exercise.</p>

nomenclature of the rudiments is
freed from technicality. The simpler definitions
are addressed to the eye, wherever
practicable, in woodcuts; and the arrow is
adopted to show the connection by action
or motion between persons and things.
Great care has been taken to make the rules

hope of lightening the labour of the teacher,
and of exciting the learner’s interest in
what he too commonly finds a dry and repulsive

<p>This work was written with a view to
supply what the Author believed to be a
desideratum in elementary education. ‘The
great source of a loose style,’ says Dr.
Blair, in his ‘Lectures upon the English
Language,’ ‘is the injudicious use of synonymous
terms.’ For one fault in construction
or idiom, at least twenty incorrect
applications of words will be found in the
periodical and light literature of the day.
The want of a critical knowledge of verbal</p>

<div class="textcol fs70">
<p class="noindent">distinctions is obviously the cause of these
errors. The Author is far from considering
this work as complete, but he hopes it will
be found to contain principles sufficiently
suggestive to enable those who use it to
continue the study to any extent for themselves.
In this edition, the work has undergone
a thorough revision, the number of

<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>Many printing errors in punctuation, missing or misplaced
italic, or a missing quote mark, have been corrected for consistency
when the context is a single paragraph.</p>

<p class="screenonly">Non-English phrases (but not single words) have
been tagged with the HTML ‘lang=’ markup. Words and phrases in Saxon have
no markup.</p>

<p>At the back of the book is a large Publisher’s Catalog and an Index
to that Catalog. The book titles, or partial titles, are <b>bolded</b>. The
original text sometimes ended the <b>bold title</b> font at the end of the
first printed line mid-title or even mid-word. In the etext the <b>bold</b>
ending has been moved in these cases to the end of the title phrase.</p>

<p class="screenonly">The page numbers of the Catalog and the Index, 1&ndash;32 in
the original book, have been modified to 1c&ndash;32c to avoid duplication.</p>

<p>The last column of the final page of the Catalog Index is missing
the page numbers. This affects the entries from ‘<span class="smcap">Tyndall</span>’
to ‘<span class="smcap">Youatt</span>’.</p>

<p>Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,
and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained. For example,
Shakspere, Shakspeare; every-day, everyday; now-a-days, nowadays;
imbedded; intire; especial; contrariety.</p>

<a href="#Page_34">Pg 34</a>, ‘over-<em>against</em> us’ replaced by ‘over&mdash;<em>against</em>&mdash;us’.<br />
<a href="#Page_109">Pg 109</a>, ‘and at at last’ replaced by ‘and at last’.<br />
<a href="#Page_128">Pg 128</a>, ‘reckless spendrift’ replaced by ‘reckless spendthrift’.<br />
<a href="#Page_152">Pg 152</a>, ‘epithetsis’ replaced by ‘epithets is’.<br />

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
